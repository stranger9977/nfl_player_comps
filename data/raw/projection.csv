Pickett also broke Pitt career records with 12,303 passing yards and broke Dan Marino's record with 81 passing touchdowns. He also used his feet to run for 241 yards and five scores in 2021.

He's a fairly toolsy pocket passer with good mobility. He operated in a passing scheme featuring vertical concepts that created big-play opportunities but left food on the plate when he failed to play chess against the back-end of the coverage. Pickett works with average anticipation but drives the ball with good velocity, which should help him shine in pre-draft passing drills. Pickett's touch and placement need work, but his accuracy stats were damaged by an inordinate amount of drops throughout his career. The top indicator for future success or failure will likely rest in a team's ability to build Pickett's trust, poise and discipline from the pocket. He can make all the throws, but he'll only be able to execute against disguised fronts and NFL pressure if he's willing to hang in and win with his eyes first.

The first-team Associated Press All-American and Player of the Year, Davey O'Brien Award winner, Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year and finalist for the Maxwell Award played in all 14 games with 13 starts (he did not start against Baylor because he was late for practice). He ranked in the top five nationally in passing efficiency (199.2), passing yardage (4,361), passing touchdowns (42, against just seven interceptions), and rushing yardage by a quarterback (123-1,001-7.3, 12 TD). He became the second quarterback in FBS history (Deshaun Watson, 2015) to throw for 4,000 yards and rush for 1,000 yards. Murray signed with Texas A&M out of high school, following his dad's footsteps to play quarterback there (Kevin set many school passing records there in the mid 1980s). Kyler was a five-star recruit and top 50 overall prospect from Allen High School in Texas who went 43-0 as a starter, totaled 14,500 yards of offense, and won the National Gatorade Player of the Year after his senior year from multiple outlets. He played in eight games for the Aggies as a true freshman, making three starts (72-121-59.5, 686 yards, five TD, seven INT passing; 53-335-6.3 rushing). After the season, he joined fellow passer Kyle Allen in transferring out of a struggling Texas A&M program. He decided on Oklahoma, sitting out the 2016 season there as a redshirt.

Mayfield completed 70.5 percent of his passes (285-of-404), throwing 43 touchdowns against just six interceptions (also rushing for 311 yards and five scores). The Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year led the nation in pass efficiency by a large margin (setting a NCAA record that he himself set the previous year) and yards per pass attempt (11.8), and finished in the top five of pretty much every other passing category. He was an all-state pick from Texas, but his lack of size scared major college programs away. He began his college days in Lubbock, walking on at Texas Tech. In his one and only season there, Mayfield started seven of eight games played, winning Big 12 Offensive Freshman of the Year (218-of-340, 64.1 percent complete, 2,315 yards, 12 touchdowns, nine interceptions). Tech head coach Kliff Kingsbury decided to open up the starting competition, so Mayfield left campus to find a new home. He sat out the 2014 season as a transfer student to Oklahoma (eventually, Big 12 coaches approved a rule that gave Mayfield an extra year of eligibility to make up for the lost season, as he was a walk-on that never received a scholarship offer from Tech). Finally on the field as the No. 1 starter in 2015, Mayfield became a second-team Associated Press All-American, Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year, finished fourth in Heisman Trophy voting, and was a finalist for the Davey O'Brien, Manning, and Walter Camp Player of the Year Awards. He also won the Burlsworth Trophy as the nation's top player who began his career as a walk-on after completing 68.1 percent of his passes (269-of-395) for 3,700 yards and 36 touchdowns against just seven interceptions. In addition to winning Burlsworth Trophy again in 2016, Mayfield was first-team All-Big 12, finished third in Heisman voting, and was a finalist for the Maxwell and Davey O'Brien Awards after leading the FBS in passing efficiency (196.4 rating, ranked first with 70.9 completion percentage, 3,965 yards, 40 touchdowns, eight interceptions). While his completion percentage was aided by horizontal throws, his mobility helped him find secondary targets and his ability to throw passes over the top of defenses also led him to lead the FBS with 11.1 yards per attempt. Mayfield was arrested for public intoxication, disorderly conduct, and fleeing/resisting arrest in February 2017. He was not suspended for those actions, though he was required to participate in alcohol education classes and community service.","Spread quarterbacks have had limited success as have small quarterbacks. Mayfield falls into both categories and has to prove he can transcend those perceived deficiencies on the next level. Having complete command of the Oklahoma offense isn't an automatic precursor for NFL success, but Mayfield's ability to process, extend plays and throw with accuracy give him a good shot. He'll be somewhat scheme-dependent so whoever takes him will need to be willing to build their offense around his strengths.",,Doug Flutie,Tough and competitive.

Hurst walked on for the Gamecocks in the summer of 2015, playing in 12 games as a receiver and tight end, starting once, and making eight catches for 106 yards. He became a star in 2016, starting all 13 games at tight end and setting school records at the position for receptions (48) and yards (616) by consistently nabbing everything thrown his way and outmuscling defenders downfield (he scored one touchdown as well). Hurst was the first sophomore in USC history to be a team captain, albeit as a 23 year-old. The following year, he earned first-team All-SEC recognition by catching 44 passes for 559 yards and two touchdowns. Hurst had Tommy John surgery as an eighth-grader.","Hurst's initial opportunity at athletic stardom came up short in baseball, but he has his second shot and plays like every down could be his last.

Jackson's father, Lamar, Sr., passed away in a car accident when Lamar was young, but even throughout the Heisman Trophy-winning 2016 season, Lamar and his mother, Felicia Jones, limited their media exposure. Of course, Jackson got plenty of exposure during his sophomore season, not only winning the Heisman but also Davey O'Brien and Maxwell Awards, as well as the ACC Player of the Year. Jackson's vision and speed as a runner helped him set a school record with 1,571 rushing yards (ranked 10th in the FBS) and 21 touchdowns on 260 carries. His cannon arm helped him pass for 3,543 yards (230-of-409, 56.2 completion percentage) for 30 touchdowns against nine interceptions. Jackson struggled throwing in the team's final three games, all losses (48 completion percentage, three touchdowns, three interceptions). Jackson played well in his junior season, as well, finishing third in the Heisman voting and earning second-team AP All-American, ACC Offensive Player of the Year, and first-team all-conference honors. He completed 59.1 percent of his passes (254-of-430) for 3,660 yards, 27 touchdowns, and 10 interceptions (four in the team's bowl loss to Mississippi State). Jackson also ran for 1,601 yards and 18 touchdowns (both in the top 10 nationally) on 232 carries, while finishing atop the FCS with 405 yards of total offense per game. In his first season with the Cardinals, Jackson started nine of 12 games (once at running back, against Auburn). His performance against Texas A&M in the Music City Bowl at the end of the year portended his future play, as he ran and threw for over 200 yards on his way to Most Valuable Player honors.","Evaluating Jackson against the NFL standards for the position will cause him to come up short. However, he has rare speed and athleticism and can single-handedly win games. Jackson's accuracy is clearly spotty and teams must decide the level of accuracy they are willing to live with relative to his ability to create explosive plays. Jackson may need to operate in an offense ready to integrate RPOs (run/pass options) along with heavy play-action.

But after two games (two catches, 27 yards), Sutton sat the rest of the year with an injury, receiving a medical redshirt. He came back with a vengeance in 2015, garnering USA Today Freshman All-American status by starting all 12 games and topping the squad with 49 receptions for 862 yards and nine touchdowns. He moonlighted with the SMU basketball team after that season (three games, three points, two rebounds). Sutton was a first-team All-AAC pick as a sophomore, ranking among the nation's top 20 in the major categories (76 catches, 1,246 yards, 10 touchdowns). His NFL size, downfield physicality, strong hands, and strider's deep speed could have led him to the next level after last season, but he chose to return to school for his fourth year. His play in 2017 only strengthened his draft stock, as the first-team all-conference selection grabbed 68 passes for 1,085 yards and 12 scores, pairing with Trey Quinn as dual 1,000-yard pass-catchers.","Sutton is a possession receiver who has the size and toughness to handle a heavier target load if necessary, but he will need to improve as a route runner because his play speed and separation is nothing special.

His grandfather, Dick Hammer, was a USC basketball player, an Olympic volleyball player, and actor -- in fact, he was one of the Mr. Marlboro Men. Sam's father, Mike, also played football at Redlands College and several other relatives were collegiate athletes. Soon enough, however, Darnold will become the top dog in the family. The High School All-American and Orange County Offensive Player of the Year (67.8 completion percentage, 2,996 yards, 39 touchdowns, eight interceptions) also excelled at basketball and baseball, even though he missed time with a broken foot (suffered during football) and a broken finger. Darnold redshirted in 2015, sitting behind Cody Kessler and Max Browne. Browne ended up transferring to Pitt after 2016, as he saw the mature, pro-sized, strong-armed, and accurate Darnold take his job. He played in all 13 games, starting the final nine, completing 67.2 percent of 366 passes for 3,086 yards, 31 touchdowns and just nine interceptions. Darnold also has the athleticism to make plays with his feet (62 rush attempts, 250 yards, two rushing touchdowns).  He was voted first-team All-Pac-12 by league coaches in 2017, completing 63.1 percent of his passes (303-of-480) for 4,143 yards and 26 touchdowns on the for the conference champs. His 13 interceptions and 11 fumbles during his sophomore season have scouts wondering about his ball security skills, however.","At the end of the day, Darnold has NFL size, arm strength, accuracy, pocket mobility, poise and field reading capability. His windup is an eyesore for sure, but he has the velocity to mitigate the additional release time. While Darnold has the mental toughness and talent to start tomorrow, early sideline seasoning could help him better process coverages in an attempt to eliminate future interceptions.

He was a first-team USA Today All-American as a high school senior, throwing for 3,186 yards and 29 touchdowns while his St. John Bosco squad won the California State Championship. UCLA coaches saw enough of his talent in the spring of 2015 (he graduated from high school one semester early) that they made him the first Bruin freshman opening-weekend starter ever. He won Pac-12 Freshman of the Year and several Freshman All-American honors after setting several school records and completing 60 percent (292-487) of his passes for 3,668  yards and 23 touchdowns (11 interceptions). Despite being only a freshman, he was in command of the offense and used his NFL size and arm to sling the ball all over the field. Rosen's sophomore season had its peaks (400 passing yards against Arizona State) and valleys (three interceptions vs. Texas A&M), and eventually ended with a season-ending injury to his throwing shoulder after six starts (59.3 completion percentage, 1,915 yards, 10 touchdowns, five interceptions). The surgery to his shoulder was not considered major, so he was throwing effectively in spring 2017 practices. Rosen had the performance of the year in the season's opening weekend, leading the Bruins in an amazing 45-44 comeback win with 491 passing yards and four touchdowns. He struggled over a four-game stretch at the start of the Pac-12 season, throwing eight of his 10 interceptions on the year. He did earn second-team All-Pac-12 notice, however, by completing 62.6 percent of his passes (283-452), throwing 26 touchdowns, and ranking second in the country with 341.5 passing yards a game (3,756 total). Rosen also suffered two concussions during the year, missing one regular season contest and their bowl game against Kansas State.","Josh Rosen's footwork and mechanics make him as pretty a quarterback as you will find in this year's draft. The biggest concern with Rosen is that his on-field success requires many elements to stay on schedule.

Rosen has the pocket poise, accuracy and intelligence to become a good NFL starter, but he needs to be willing to take what defenses give him more frequently. Rosen will need to quell concerns surrounding leadership and coachability early on in order to establish a strong first impression and get his career off on the right foot.","""He wasn't the guy everyone rallied around in college and you don't have to dig around for too long to find people who said he was hard to coach.

Hines also caught 26 passes for 152 yards, returned 11 punts for 135 yards and a score, and brought back 21 kickoffs for 469 yards.

Davis was among the nation's leading receivers as a junior (90-1,436, 12 TDs) before garnering first-team All-American honors in 2016 by ranking in the top 10 in the three major receiving categories -- 97 catches (eighth), 1,500 yards (seventh), 19 touchdowns (tied-first).","Touchdown juggernaut who was a four-year model of production and consistency in college.

Marquise Williams took the helm for four years in Chapel Hill, relegating the Mr. Ohio Football to a reserve role (82 of 125 for 1,014 yards, 11 touchdowns, five interceptions in 2014-2015). Trubisky had a breakout 2016 season, but only received third-team All-ACC honors because of the presence of the top two Heisman Trophy vote-getters (Louisville's Lamar Jackson and Clemson's Deshaun Watson).

Despite playing in a spread-based offense, he's a full-field reader who does a very good job of getting an early read on the safeties before crafting his course of action. Trubisky will have to become much more pocket aware and do a better job of recognizing and attacking blitzes to back NFL defensive coordinators off. He hasn't put all the pieces together yet, but the puzzle is all right in front. Trubisky projects as a good starting quarterback with a high floor and the potential to be great.","""There are times he looks like another Carson Wentz and then there are times he looks like Blaine Gabbert.

Built to withstand physical challenges of the position. Calm field general. Very good pocket mobility. Can slide around circumference of the pocket without having to drop his eyes from their task.

Locates safeties and reads their intentions immediately after the snap. Quick through his progressions and will double back to targets if his protection allows him time. Pocket mechanics and throwing motion are solid. Tough and competitive. Shows courage and poise in the pocket. Throws passes from balanced platforms and rarely defaults to an off-balance throw unnecessarily. Has all the arm you need. NFL call sheets will be wide open with Trubisky at the helm. Can dial up deep field-side outs with accuracy. Ball comes humming out of his hand when he needs to spike his velocity. Arm talent to whip a catchable throw from difficult angles to targets outside the numbers. Makes the standard ""pitch and catch"" throws with consistent accuracy. Ball usually comes out on time. His 62.1 completion percentage on intermediate throws easily outpaces the top quarterbacks in this draft. Possesses get-away quickness to avoid sudden pressure from a-gap blitzers with the speed to damage the defensive cause once he leaves the pocket.",Almost 98 percent of his dropbacks came from shotgun. Will have to learn NFL footwork from under center which could take time. Benefits from offense loaded with RPOs (run-pass option) that pull linebackers forward and open easier throwing windows. Played in space-based passing attack that didn't often ask him to throw to tight windows in traffic. Arm slot will drop way down causing batted balls at line of scrimmage. Too willing to float balls rather than air-mailing them out of bounds when he's making a bail-out throw against pressure. Needs better drive accuracy between the hashes. Has a tendency to leave throws in hip pocket of moving targets. Inconsistent deep ball touch. Has touchdown opportunities he babies and invites defenders time to recover. Not always pocket aware.

Hopkins re-wrote the Clemson receiving record books in 2012 with 18 receiving touchdowns and to put that in perspective the No. 2 player in the ACC in touchdown grabs was NC State’s Bryan Underwood with 10. Hopkins does a nice job setting up his routes to keep defenders off balance and attack the ball at its highest point – if the ball is thrown in Hopkins area, he goes and gets it. He has fluid body control and the focus to be a reliable starting WR option in the NFL. Should be in the conversation to be one of the first receivers drafted, probably in the late first round range.","When Hopkins makes a play in front of his home crowd, you’ll hear the throng cheer “Nuuuk”. Though his childhood nickname came from a special brand of baby pacifier he required because he bit through most others, the confident receiver will tell you he’s added another reason for that moniker – he feels almost nuclear in his explosion on the field. And after a stand-out junior season, which capped an overall productive three-year career at Clemson, NFL scouts agree he’s got a chance to be a significant contributor on Sundays.

The nephew of the late Terry Smith, who caught 162 passes for Clemson from 1990-1993, was yet another top South Carolina recruit the Tigers kept in-state despite great interest from major programs across the country. Hopkins earned the team’s Rookie of the Year award in 2010, starting eight of 12 games played and leading the team with 52 catches (covering 637 yards and four touchdowns) – and he joined the Clemson basketball team as a reserve after the season, one year after leading his high school team to a state title. He played in every game, starting 11, as a sophomore in 2011, being somewhat overlooked despite nearly reaching 1,000 receiving yards (978 on 72 catches, also five touchdowns) because of the electric play of freshman Sammy Watkins.  Hopkins suffered a mild concussion in a car accident on his way to go to the team’s disappointing 70-33 Orange Bowl loss to West Virginia, but he still managed a school bowl-record 10 catches for 107 yards and a touchdown. Hopkins was good over his first two seasons in Death Valley, but in 2012, he was great, finishing with a single-season school record 1,405 receiving yards. Hopkins also set a new ACC-mark with 18 receiving scores, adding a team-best 82 catches. Despite his quarterback deciding to return for his senior season, Hopkins decided to depart after his record-breaking junior season, leaving with a school record for 100-yard receiving games (12).",,Roddy White,"Presents good height and length for an outside receiver, also has some lower-body strength for explosion off the line of scrimmage and in his cuts.

He was Notre Dame’s No. 1 offensive weapon in 2012, lining up out wide as a WR or in-line as a traditional TE, and was the type of target defensive coordinators had to game plan against. Eifert is a fluid pass-catcher with vacuum hands and the hand/eye coordination to make tough catches and although he doesn’t create a lot of space, he secures grabs in traffic, showing outstanding tracking and high-pointing ability. He is a soft spoken guy, but an animal on the field and a much better blocker than given credit, improving in leaps and bounds the past three years with excellent effort – projects as a starting NFL TE with excellent potential as both a receiver and blocker.","Some thought an average tight end class would push the tall, athletic Eifert into the 2012 draft as a redshirt sophomore. After all, it was the decision of Kyle Rudolph’s to leave a season early for the 2011 draft (he was picked in the second round by the Vikings) opened the door for Eifert to become a star. And while a freshman at quarterback hurt his production as a junior, he still led the team in receiving in 2012 with a team-best 50 catches for 685 yards and 4 touchdowns, winning the Mackey Award (Nation’s top TE). Eifert decided to skip his final season of eligibility and enter the 2013 NFL Draft.

Tall, lean frame. Lines up with his hand down, in an H-back role, in the slot and outside. Threatens the seam with his long strides off the snap, takes a lot of hits across the middle and bounces up. Nice job gaining position in coverage with very good footwork, taking pride in his routes and showing much improvement in this area. Elevates well to go up and attack the ball, just needs an opportunity and chances are he’ll come down with it – very good at mid-air adjustments, making a lot of catches with his feet off the ground. Uses his height, length and strong hands to snatch passes out of the air. Flashes quick feet on out-cuts to be an effective safety valve. Fights through arm tackles to get extra yardage. Gets off the line effectively from a three-point stance, can shimmy past a defender near the line to get into his route. Gives effort as an in-line blocker, uses his length to hold off defensive ends, uses agility to get angle and create outside running lane. Also works hard to prevent defenders from reaching teammates downfield. Productive in his three seasons, leaving Notre Dame with just about every school receiving record for a TE including catches (140) and receiving yards (1,840).","Lean receiver-like build. Does not play with consistent explosiveness and leverage when blocking in-line, will get pulled down by NFL ends and miss reach-blocks against quicker ends. Still growing as a blocker and needs to use better angles. Stronger linebackers will rip off his blocks and ride him off his route when he does not use his hands effectively.

The Tar Heel may need to thank Larry Fedora for bringing in his offense, as Bernard was able to show off his receiving and pass protection skills. This class may lack a clear cut, first-round running back, but Bernard is one of a couple ball carriers that has a shot to be selected in the first 32 picks.","Giovani Bernard's career as a Tar Heel did not kickoff as expected. On the team's third day of practice, ""Gio"" tore the ACL in his right knee and was forced to redshirt the 2010 season. The Florida native and brother of Yvenson, who was an all-conference running back at Oregon State, didn't waste any time once returning to the field in 2011, and was quickly named the starter after clearly separating himself from others at the position. UNC hired Larry Fedora during the offseason, and he implemented a no-huddle, shotgun heavy offense, something Bernard wasn't accustomed to. Gio was slowed early in the 2012 season after experiencing some discomfort in his knee in the opener against Elon, and the running back was sidelined for two full games. The redshirt sophomore did return to the field against East Carolina and remained there for the next nine games.
<br><br>
After taking over lead back duties as a redshirt freshman, Bernard rushed for 1,253 yards and 13 touchdowns on 239 carries. He flashed plenty of receiving ability as well, catching 45 passes for 362 yards and one touchdown.He was forced to make a shift in his play style in 2012, as the Tar Heels focused on tempo and the shotgun formation. The blocking scheme and plays were a change for Bernard, but he still managed 1,228 rushing yards and 12 touchdowns on 184 carries. The stocky running back did benefit from the passing mentality UNC obtained, since he caught 47 passes for 490 yards and five touchdowns.

He has developed as a blocker and is usually sure-handed, but still needs to improve his consistency in both areas. While he’s No. 2 in the TE rankings for most, it wouldn’t be surprising if some teams grade him higher than Notre Dame’s Tyler Eifert as he is a better TE prospect than Fleener a year ago –- projecting as a top-40 prospect, Ertz has a good chance to be the first TE in Stanford history to be drafted in the first round.","Ertz had a strong incentive to leave The Farm after his redshirt sophomore season because high-profile teammates quarterback Andrew Luck, tight end Coby Fleener, and offensive line stars David DeCastro and Jonathan Martin are no longer around to aid his cause. But staying in Palo Alto for another year gave him the chance to be Stanford’s top offensive weapon and Ertz took advantage of the opportunity in 2012.
<br><br>
He was rated the top tight end recruit in the nation coming out of Monte Vista High School, which is located only one hour north of Stanford’s campus. After redshirting in 2009, Ertz became a regular contributor the next season (16-190, 5 TD), catching a touchdown in each of the team’s final three games. He started last season with the same type of streak, scoring once in each of the Cardinal’s three games, and played well throughout the first seven games. Unfortunately, Ertz suffered an injury to his right knee blocking while Stanford received the opening kickoff against USC. He missed the next three games and made a minimal impact against Notre Dame before appearing healthy again in the team’s Fiesta Bowl loss to Oklahoma State (4-38, TD).
<br><br>
Ertz became the feature tight end in 2012 as a junior and started all 14 games, leading the team in just about every receiving category.

Sturdy, well-built frame, adding 30 pounds of bulk and muscle since he arrived in Palo Alto. Tough with the ball in his hands and isn’t afraid to deliver hits, lowering his pads and finishing runs. Not afraid to get physical as a blocker and gives good effort in this area, always looking for someone to block downfield. Tracks the ball well and does a nice job adjusting his frame to make the tough catch, extending and plucking. Looks like he has glue on his hands with some of the catches he is able to make. Does a nice job selling his patterns, getting good depth in his routes and immediately looking for the ball out of his breaks. Nice job deceiving defenders and finding soft spots in coverage to make something happen after the catch, averaging over 13 yards per catch in 2012. Has experience all over the offense for Stanford, lining up in-line, slot and out wide, but looked most comfortable in the slot. In 2012 Ertz doubled Coby Fleener’s production from the year before, earning All-American honors as a Mackey Award finalist.

Nice job adding bulk to his frame, but needs to continue to develop his strength to sustain blocks at the line of scrimmage.

His start as a true freshman was so good that he joined the Doak Walker Award watch list during the season; most of his 605 rushing yards and eight scores came in the first six weeks of the year, before Edwin Baker finished off the year as the lead back. Bell flipped the script on Baker in 2011, however, starting the last six games after coming off the bench over the first eight (182-948, 13 TD; 35-267 receiving). Big Ten coaches named him honorable mention all-conference for his efforts.

While he isn’t particularly big, strong or explosive, he picks his way through traffic well and is a reliable runner. Though not a burner like others in this class, Ball’s durability and efficient zone running make him a likely mid-round pick.","Most analysts expected Ball to enter the 2012 NFL Draft because of his great junior season and the short careers of running backs at the next level. Ball was heavily recruited after clearing 5,000 yards and scoring 71 times in his final two years in high school. He earned playing time despite the Badgers’ depth at the running back spot in 2009, finishing second on the team with 391 rushing yards – most coming in the final five games of the year. He only received four starts in 2010 as John Clay got the majority of carries early in the year, but finished with 996 yards and 18 touchdowns as the team’s top back to finish off the season.  He became “the man” in the Wisconsin backfield as a junior, losing 25 pounds and generally focusing his efforts on his way to being named Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year and a Heisman Trophy finalist. Ball started all 14 games and leading the nation with 1,923 rushing yards and 33 rushing touchdowns. All this despite not hitting 100 yards in three of the first four contests as lopsided scores in the Badgers’ favor limited his carries and took away the threat of quarterback Russell Wilson passing the ball. He also tied Barry Sanders’ NCAA record with 39 total touchdowns and earned consensus All-American honors, and finished the year strong with 164 yards and a touchdown against Oregon in the Rose Bowl.

The third-round grade he received from the NFL advisory committee pushed him towards returning to school, as did his desire to finish his degree and to become one of the top rushers in Wisconsin history. Ball and the Badgers entered the season with high expectations. Things went sour early for Montee though. He was assaulted near the Madison campus over the summer, suffering a concussion in the incident. The graduation of Russell Wilson left a void that Wisconsin was never really able to replace.

His production grew, however, as the then redshirt sophomore hauled in 51 grabs for 780 yards and seven touchdowns.

This certainly helps his comfort blocking on the edge and as a receiver who picks up yards after the catch. In fact, McDonald is still learning how to use his frame effectively. Teams could view the Rice product as an inline prospect or as a Joker mismatch, but either way McDonald should be selected on the second day.","McDonald, the son of a former Texas Longhorns linebacker, did not receive the attention of large collegiate programs out of high school. One reason could be his hometown of Winnie, Texas, which has a population of less than 3,500 people. Even though he comes from a small town, McDonald has big-time talent and displayed plenty of that during Senior Bowl week.

Despite his size and NFL projection, McDonald was mostly used as a slot receiver throughout his career, creating a size and physical mismatch in both the passing and running games. In his first season, McDonald caught 12 passes but missed two games due to an injury. He quickly turned into Rice's top receiving option in 2010, amassing 396 yards and eight touchdowns on 28 receptions. In that same year, McDonald was named the Owls' top receiver after earning the George R. Brown Award. In 2011, McDonald continued his consistent production, catching 43 passes for 452 yards and five touchdowns.

Wheaton used his track speed to break off long runs from short routes and get behind defenders for big plays. Wheaton isn't solely limited to the slot, and he will likely find himself as a first or second round selection due to his ability to test defenses horizontally and vertically.","Wheaton might not be biggest receiver in the 2013 draft class, but he towers above the last two playmakers coming out of Corvallis –- Jacquizz and James Rodgers, who averaged about 5-foot-6, 190 pounds at their respective combines. His athleticism certainly matches up with the Rodgers brothers, as well, because not only was Wheaton a solid high school football talent among the best players coming out of Arizona in 2008, but he also won 400- and 800-meter races at junior national track meets before also performing well in state high school meets. 
<br><br>
His speed and athleticism translated onto the field as a true freshman, as he was used on fly sweeps (11 rushes for 79 yards and a score) and as a reserve receiver (8-89). Wheaton led the Beavers in receiving in 2010, starting eight of 12 games played with James Rodgers on the sideline (55-675, four TD) and was again used regularly on sweeps (27-220, two TD), finishing the year with a 10-catch, 137-yard effort against rival Oregon (where his cousin, Kenny, played in the mid-1990s) in the Civil War. He earned honorable mention All-Pac 12 honors while starting all 12 games as a junior, again leading the team in receiving (73-986, TD) and contributing as a runner (25-190).",,Antonio Brown,"His quickness is blatant and dangerous. Whether taking off from the slot or outside, his feet are literally a step ahead of his defender on everything from speed outs, crossers, to jerk routes.  Displays the flexibility to grab throws behind him or over his shoulder when running deep. He’ll also extend away from his body to bring in high or wide throws, and will stutter on the sideline to ensure he makes the catch in-bounds. Possesses some thickness to his frame, and is willing to lower his shoulder to get the extra yard – often diving under defenders to get as many as possible. Wheaton also dabbled in track while at OSU, reminding scouts of his elite speed.","While he can elude defenders in the open field, he’s not necessarily elite making men miss after the catch. Too often he will let the ball into his frame as opposed to attacking it. Will round off deeper pattern that consist of him coming back to the quarterback.

He won the long jump title at the U.S. Olympic trials, finishing 10th in the event in London. If he can prove himself as a more consistent route runner, the vertical threat that his pure speed makes him will potentially attract some Day 2 looks.","Goodwin’s exploits on the track –- both in high school and college –- intrigue NFL scouts as much as his efforts on the field.

He started 36 games over the past three years, losing just two to injury (2009 vs. Washington with a bruised shoulder, 2010 vs. Notre Dame with a high ankle sprain). He ended his career with school passing records for yardage and touchdowns –- no mean feat at a school where Heisman Trophy winners Carson Palmer and Matt Leinart once took snaps.  Barkley improved his touchdown-to-interception ratio (15-14 in 2009, 26-12 in 2010, 39-7 in 2011), as well as his completion percentage (59.9 percent, 62.6 percent, 69.1 percent), in his first three seasons. His 2011 season included a school-record 468 yards passing over Arizona and two six-touchdown efforts against Colorado and UCLA, earning him USC’s team MVP award. He also garnered second-team All-Pac-12 and third-team Associated Press All-American honors, as well as help him finish sixth in the Heisman Trophy voting and as a finalist for the Manning and Wuerffel Awards.

At times Reed was more of a glorified running back, carrying the ball for a total of 48 times in the final three games of the season, half of those occurring in the bowl game against Penn State. In 2011, Reed made 10 starts at tight end after missing time in two games do to a lingering hamstring issue. Finally, as a junior, Reed came into his own in 2012 and looked like a natural at the tight end position while leading the Gators in receiving. He did not end the season on a high note, however, as Reed was reportedly benched in the Gators bowl game for attitude issues.

During his first year of seeing the field as a redshirt freshman, Reed accounted for 328 rushing yards and five touchdowns on 77 carries.

With Jake Fromm and Justin Fields on the roster in 2018, however, Bennett transferred to Jones College (1,840 yards, 16 TDs in 12 games).

His brother, Tony, was a DB at UCLA and his brother, Jordan, was a WR at Sterling College in Kansas. His father, Mark, played football at San Jose State. Travis played his first four years at Oregon before transferring to USC for the 2022 season.

Dye tied for 10th in the FBS that season with 16 rushing touchdowns in 14 games (12 starts). At USC in 2022, Dye garnered second-team all-conference accolades as the team's top rusher (145-884-6.1, nine TDs; 21-202-9.6 receiving) even though he sustained a leg injury that ended his season after 10 starts. -- by Chad Reuter","Instinctive runner with modest size who finds ways to squeeze the most he can out of almost every run.
