Texas won the battle to secure his services for 2020 and he came through as a true freshman, leading the Longhorns with 703 rushing yards. He broke the school record, averaging 8.2 yards on 86 carries (15-196-13.1, two TDs receiving). Robinson started 10 games in 2021, garnering first-team All-Big 12 honors by again leading Texas with 1,127 yards and 11 scores on the ground and ranking eighth in the FBS with 142.2 all-purpose yards per game. His final season in Austin was memorable, as he won the Doak Walker Award as the nation's top running back.

","<p>Full-menu back blending a smorgasbord of position-specific traits that allow him to affect games. Robinson is well-built with a compact lower half and pairs a low center of gravity with agile feet. There are elements of both fight and flight in his running style, but defenders can never be quite sure what they are going to get. He’s a capable inside/outside runner with unique footwork to stack moves and reset pathways, but can plow into tacklers at a moment’s notice using elite contact balance to keep the run rolling. He might need to dial back efforts to search out big runs so frequently and take what is there a little more often to keep from getting bogged down. His pass-catching talent ensures the opportunity for Robinson to see a high number of touches. He has a chance to become one of the more productive runners in the league very quickly.</p>

He played in nine games behind Mac Jones for the national champions in 2020 (13-22-59.1%, 156 yards, one TD). Young took over the starting job in 2021 and won the Heisman Trophy and Maxwell Award as the nation's top player as well as the Davey O'Brien and Manning Awards as the nation's top quarterback. The Associated Press first-team All-American and SEC Offensive Player of the Year ranked second in the FBS with a school-record 4,872 yards and 47 passing touchdowns, third in passing efficiency (167.5) and pass attempts (547) and tied for third in pass completions (366).

","<p>Slightly built with measurables that fall below the standard for the quarterback position, Young’s talent and face-of-the-franchise potential could force teams to focus more on his game film and less on his size. Young has had the advantage of working with a former NFL head coach (Bill O’Brien) who understands the challenges facing a pro quarterback. He’s a full-field reader whose confident demeanor on the field oozes off the tape but never becomes unbridled cockiness. He’s thoughtful in where he wants to go with the football and keeps the turnover count low. The deep ball is nothing special and his drive velocity fails to stand out, but he has enough arm strength to make the necessary throws. Young is perfectly capable of extending plays both inside and outside the pocket, but teams will want him to stay on schedule a little more often as a pro passer. He’s poised in the face of both physical and situational pressure and possesses a full offering of intangibles that helps set him apart from some of the more physically gifted quarterbacks in this class.</p>

Abanikanda joined the Panthers in 2020, playing in seven games off the bench (28-95-3.4, one TD rushing; 2-11-5.5, one TD receiving), and led the team in rushing yards as a sophomore (123-651-5.3, seven TDs; 24-197-8.2, one TD receiving; 7-206-29.4, one TD kick return in 13 games, six starts). He burst onto the national scene as a junior, garnering third-team Associated Press All-American and first-team All-ACC honors after leading the Panthers with 1,431 rushing yards (239 carries, 6.0 per), tying for the FBS lead with 20 rushing touchdowns and ranking seventh with 1,805 all-purpose yards (12-146-12.2, one TD receiving: 12-228-19.0 kick returns) in 11 starts. Abanikanda opted out of the team's Sun Bowl game to prepare for the draft. His father, Saidi, was born in Nigeria, ran track at Georgia Tech and was eventually asked to join the football team. His brother, Michael, played football at Buffalo and Temple. -- by Chad Reuter</p>
","<p>A zone-scheme runner with early down size, Abanikanda can be a bit inconsistent with his reads and tempo early in the run. However, he has plant-and-go agility and is able to snap off cuts at tight angles to elude short-area traffic when needed. He has terrific top-end speed to gash a poorly fitted run front, but he needs to run with better discipline and downhill decisiveness to stay ahead of NFL speed. Abanikanda isn't much of a third down option, but he does have the size and talent to compete for a RB2/3 slot early on with a chance to move up the depth chart in time.</p>

","<p>Talented but enigmatic receiver with game tape that shows a lack of consistency and impressive ball skills.

The route inefficiencies can be cleaned up, but Rice must play with better consistency and urgency to find long-term NFL reps.</p>

","<p>Dual-threat quarterback with an elite physical profile and a lot of work that needs to be done to reach a potentially high ceiling. Richardson’s frame, arm talent and mobility will demand respect as a potential first-round option. He has the ability to make plays on the move that very few of his NFL peers will be able to make. However, but his accuracy on short and simple throws left much to be desired due, in part, to shoddy footwork and inconsistent rhythm. The footwork issues can be corrected, but the challenge will be determining whether he can be at least a functionally accurate passer at the next level. Richardson’s potential to strike with the deep ball, attack the secondary from sideline to sideline and gash teams with his legs creates greater leeway in his projection as a developmental prospect. Ultimately, he will succeed or fail based on his ability to play with better post-snap recognition and deliver the football with consistency.</p>

","<p>Levis is one of the most physically gifted quarterbacks in the draft, but there are warts in his game that might not be easily corrected.

He struggled to put together an extended period of high-caliber quarterback play in 2022, but was also dealing with injuries that he fought his way through for much of the season. Levis has the arm to beat coverages on all three levels, but inadequate placement and accuracy have created a lot of uncatchable throws. He’s a capable runner outside the pocket but needs to improve his feel for pressure and his consistency when throwing on the move.

In 2019, Hall missed time with concussions but started two times in seven games played (31-46-67.4, 420 yards, one TD passing; 29-139-4.8, three TD rushing).

His lack of drive velocity creates smaller margins for error and his timing needs to be impeccable to beat NFL man coverage. Hall operates with ideal poise from the pocket. He does an adequate job of reading coverages and getting rid of the ball without taking sacks. The size and arm strength will concern some teams, but offenses operating out of heavy play-action with levels-based route concepts could target him as a solid future backup.</p>

The former Hickory Ridge High School (N.C.) star started 11 of 12 appearances in 2019 (35-751-21.5, six TDs) before transferring to Tarleton State the following semester. He never played for Tarleton, transferring again to South Carolina for the 2020 season, but the NCAA did not grant him eligibility until the fifth game of the year. Brooks started four of six games played that season (11-100-9.1) and the first six games of 2021 (14-181-12.9, one TD) before leaving the program for personal reasons. He returned to the team in the summer of 2022 and ended up starting 12 games for the Gamecocks (33-504-15.3, one TD receiving; 4-51-12.8, one TD rushing) but did not play in the Gator Bowl against Notre Dame because of what South Carolina coach Shane Beamer described as an off-field issue. -- by Chad Reuter</p>
","<p>Brooks was not granted eligibility by the NCAA until the fifth game of the 2020 season and he stepped away from the South Carolina program for the second half of the 2021 season. Those missed games help explain his limited college production, but his 2022 game film -- when he started 12 games -- failed to stand out. However, his play strength and ball skills are clearly noticeable on tape. He’s a high-cut, leggy route runner who struggles to outmaneuver coverage getting in and out of breaks. He’s highly competitive on 50/50 balls and has run-after-catch talent to have his moments in the open field, but his poor speed testing at the NFL Scouting Combine could be tough for him to overcome.</p>

His decision to stay near home for college paid off his true freshman year, as he started five of 12 games played (7-89-12.7, one TD). McBride was a first-team All-Mountain West Conference pick as a sophomore (45-560-12.4, four TDs in 12 games, 11 starts) and a second-team selection the following season (team-high 22-330-14.0, four TDs in four starts). He considered transferring before the Mountain West decided to play a shortened fall season due to COVID-19 concerns. Rams fans were happy McBride stayed for 2020 and 2021, when he won the John Mackey Award as the nation's best tight end. The first-team Associated Press All-American and all-league selection ranked ninth in the country with 90 receptions and led the team with 1,121 receiving yards (setting school career records in both categories) despite scoring only once through the air. On the final play of his collegiate career, he ran a fake punt 69 yards for a score against Nevada. -- by Chad Reuter</p>
","<p>Two-way tight end with the size, strength and ball skills to help impact games in-line and in space. McBride has room for improvement at the point of attack, but possesses the thickness and determination of a true, in-line blocker. He'll need to improve his angles and play strength to even out the wins and losses against NFL competition. McBride lacks top-end speed and quickness into the route, but he can snap off route breaks and has the body control and sticky hands to win contested catch battles. Long athletes could suffocate his catch space if he doesn't play with more physicality and aggression during the route. McBride is solid in all phases and should appeal to every team looking for a combination tight end with early starting potential.</p>

Hall was the first unanimous All-American in Iowa State history, finished sixth in the Heisman Trophy voting and was a runner-up for the Doak Walker Award (top collegiate running back). He was a Doak Walker finalist, first-team Associated Press All-American and once again the Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year in 2021, ranking seventh in the nation with 1,472 rushing yards (253 carries, 5.8 per) and tying for third with 20 rushing touchdowns.

His running style is willful when it needs to be and he's adept at moving the chains on &quot;got to have it&quot; short-yardage carries.

He also received Division I college basketball scholarship offers. His father, Kenny, is among the top scorers in Davidson's storied history.

","<p>Wilson's game is lacking in polish, but some scouts believe his play strength and run-after-catch ability make him a more valuable draft commodity than Ohio State teammate Chris Olave.

His long speed is good, but the acceleration burst is what makes him such an effective separator in space. He might not be smooth getting there, but he has eye-popping ball skills when it's time to go make a play.

Catch toughness can be inconsistent when contested or in heavily trafficked areas. He has all the juice to find consistent separation on vertical, over and post/corner routes and could see monstrous production if paired with a high-end talent at quarterback. The ACL tear could play a role in determining his ultimate draft destination, but it's unlikely to change his game.</p>

He started all 14 games the next season, throwing for 1,969 yards (180-310-58.1) and 12 touchdowns (six INTs) while scoring three times on the ground (117-220-1.9). The former top-10, pro-style quarterback recruit from Ocean Township High School in New Jersey was the full-time starter as a junior, as well, completing 61.6 percent of his passes (289-of-469) for 3,098 yards and 13 touchdowns against nine interceptions (also 95-110-1.2, two TDs rushing). Pickett was the Quick Lane Bowl MVP (27-of-39, 361 yards, three TDs) in the team's win over Eastern Michigan, setting a school record with a 96-yard TD pass.

Pickett decided to return to school instead of going to the NFL for one final season in 2021, which paid off handsomely with many awards (Johnny Unitas Golden Arm, Senior CLASS Award, second-team Associated Press All-American, ACC Player of the Year and Offensive Player of the Year) in addition to landing finalist spots for the Heisman Trophy (finished third in the voting), Maxwell Award, Walter Camp Player of the Year and Davey O'Brien Award. He led the Panthers to the ACC Championship, ranked sixth in the FBS with a school-record 4,319 passing yards and fourth with 334 completions (497 attempts, 67.2 percent) and an ACC-record 42 passing touchdowns (just seven INT). Pickett also broke Pitt career records with 12,303 passing yards and broke Dan Marino's record with 81 passing touchdowns. He also used his feet to run for 241 yards and five scores in 2021.

","<p>Pickett has five years of game experience and four years of starting experience for Pitt. He's a fairly toolsy pocket passer with good mobility. He operated in a passing scheme featuring vertical concepts that created big-play opportunities but left food on the plate when he failed to play chess against the back-end of the coverage. Pickett works with average anticipation but drives the ball with good velocity, which should help him shine in pre-draft passing drills. Pickett's touch and placement need work, but his accuracy stats were damaged by an inordinate amount of drops throughout his career. The top indicator for future success or failure will likely rest in a team's ability to build Pickett's trust, poise and discipline from the pocket. He can make all the throws, but he'll only be able to execute against disguised fronts and NFL pressure if he's willing to hang in and win with his eyes first. He carries a boom/bust label, but the 2021 tape and productivity showed off his potential to become a good starter in time.</p>

He gained 15 pounds of solid muscle between his freshman and sophomore seasons at Ohio State, and there was an immediate benefit. Olave garnered third-team All-Big Ten accolades, becoming an essential target for Heisman Trophy finalist quarterback Justin Fields as the team leader in receiving yards and touchdowns (48-840-17.5, 12 TDs in 14 games, six starts). Olave showed maturity at the end of the season, taking the blame for slipping on a route where Fields threw an interception at the end of the national semifinal game against Clemson. He was the Buckeyes' top receiving option in 2020, finishing the season among the national leaders in receptions and receiving yards (50-729-14.6) while starting all seven games to earn first-team all-conference honors for the FBS runner-up. He received second-team Associated Press All-American and first-team all-conference notice in his final year, tying for sixth in the FBS with 13 receiving TDs to become the school's all-time leader in the category. His 35 beat out NFL stars David Boston, Cris Carter and Santonio Holmes. Olave caught 65 passes for 936 yards (14.4 per rec.) in 12 starts for the Buckeyes, opting out of the team's bowl game to prepare for the NFL draft. He was also named a finalist for the Senior CLASS Award for excellence on and off the field. -- by Chad Reuter</p>
","<p>The quiet storm of the Ohio State wide receiver corps, Olave is smooth, steady and makes things happen. His movements are fluid and easy from snap to the catch and all points between. He's fast but efficient and plays with the bend and foot agility to uncover on all three levels. Olave possesses natural, well-rounded ball skills but needs to add play strength to ward off the physical challenges that are headed his way. His play traits should allow for success beyond the scheme and talent advantages surrounding him at Ohio State. He is an inside/outside hybrid appealing to offenses looking for a field-stretcher with the ability to take on a sizable catch load.</p>

His football prowess is what has turned heads, though, beginning with a strong true freshman season in 2019 (93-567-14.5, five TDs in 13 games, nine starts). London led the Trojans with 502 receiving yards (33 receptions, 15.2 per rec., three TDs) while starting all six games in 2020, receiving second-team All-Pac-12 accolades from league coaches. London missed the end of the 2021 season with a fractured right ankle but impressed Associated Press voters (who selected him as a third-team All-American) and league coaches (Offensive Player of the Year, first-team all-conference) by leading his squad with 88 receptions and 1,084 receiving yards (12.3 per rec.) and tying for the team lead with seven scores in just eight starts. -- by Chad Reuter</p>

London's pro career would benefit from playing with a diverse receiving corps that allows play-callers to play to London's strengths.</p>

An offer never came, so he signed with Iowa State. The 2016 first-team all-state pick (66-1,240 with 15 TDs) redshirted his first year in Ames but came on to start three of 13 games played the following year (11-137-12.5, three TDs). Kolar garnered third-team Associated Press All-American and first-team All-Big 12 status in 2019, catching 51 passes for 697 yards (13.7 per rec.) and a team-high seven touchdowns in 13 games (10 starts). He was a finalist for the John Mackey Award in 2020 and landed third-team AP All-American and first-team all-conference accolades (44-591-13.4, team-high seven receiving TDs in 11 games, five starts).

","<p>A tight end with elite measurements and statistical production, Kolar's tape can be a little bit average when studying the entire body of work. Despite his outstanding size and length, Kolar is not very aggressive or effective as a point-of-attack blocker.

He finds a way to open throwing windows for his quarterback. He has box-out talent to keep catch windows clean and his quiet, sticky hands are automatic. I'm not sure his college production will travel with him, but he should become a solid move tight end as a Day 2 selection.</p>

He tested positive for COVID-19 in December but did not miss any games as the Flames' regular-season game against Coastal Carolina was canceled (they beat Coastal in the Mortgage Cure Bowl). They took a step back in 2021 (going 8-5) though Willis made plays through the air (207-of-339, 61.1%, 2,857 yards, 27 TDs, 12 INTs) and led the squad in rushing (197-878-4.5, 13 TDs). He was named the LendingTree Bowl MVP after leading Liberty to a win over Eastern Michigan (13-of-24, 231 yards, 3 TDs; 8-58, 2 TDs rushing). Willis played two seasons for the Tigers, playing in seven games in 2017 (6-of-7, 45 yards, one TD; 16-221-13.8, one TD rushing) and nine contests the following year (5-of-7, 24 yards passing; 12-88-7.3, one TD rushing).

","<p>Upside quarterback with special parts of his game, but with no guarantee they will be assembled properly into a finished product. Willis uses his rare combination of elite rushing talent and a rocket-launching right arm to unlock explosive plays in two different ways. He has the arm to beat safeties to the deepest parts of the field and makes impressive throws from inside and outside the pocket. On the flip side, Willis' mechanical and operational inconsistencies lead to erratic timing and accuracy, and he doesn't throw with enough touch. Protection and receiver separation were both issues, but Willis also pressed over the second half of the season and never looked comfortable in the Liberty offense. On the pro level, additional film work and a layered, pro-style passing attack could allow for more focused reads and help him see the field faster and more clearly from the pocket. Play-callers must lean into his special talent as a runner and include called runs into the game plan. Even if Willis fails to reach his passing potential, running ability doesn't slump and he has the talent to produce on the ground at a level between Jalen Hurts and Lamar Jackson.</p>

He was a four-star recruit and Mr. Football in the state of Kentucky as a senior at Western Hills High School (6,795 career rushing yards, averaged 11 yards per carry).

He had won the Paul Hornung Award as Kentucky's top high school football player in 2018 and was a finalist for the Paul Hornung Award as college football's most versatile player the following fall.

A lack of length and play strength could be a concern until he tightens up the route-running to prevent contested catches.

","<p>Four-year starter and four-year winner whose hard work at his craft altered his standing from good college quarterback to early-round draft pick. There is nothing special about Ridder's size or arm talent but his improved confidence and field command has really helped him mature at the position. He plays in rhythm and operates with consistently repeatable footwork and mechanics. He's intelligent and processes quickly, which should help him find where the football needs to go regardless of passing scheme. Getting the ball to NFL targets accurately and safely, however, is not a given. Despite favorable mechanics, his accuracy and ball placement need work and he doesn't have the arm strength or release quickness to consistently survive off-target throws against pro coverage. He can run but is more of a pocket passer who can win with his legs than a true dual-threat quarterback.</p>

It's a million dollars in the air. If you want it, you go get it.&quot; Big Ten coaches appreciated his financial acumen, voting him third-team all-conference at receiver (PSU leader with 52 receptions, 884 yards, eight scores with 17.0 yards per catch in nine starts) and honorable mention as a punt returner (8-197-24.6, one TD). Dotson capped off his career with 2021 third-team Associated Press All-American and second-team All-Big Ten accolades at receiver, leading Penn State with 91 receptions and 1,182 receiving yards and tying for eighth in the country with 12 receiving scores in 12 starts (opted out of the team's bowl game to prepare for the NFL draft). He also received third-team all-league notice for his return abilities (14-104-7.4 punt returns). Dotson initially committed to UCLA as a top 150 overall recruit nationally but eventually decided to stay close to Nazareth, where he grew up. He played in eight games (12-203-15.6) with starts in the final four contests as a true freshman before starting all 13 appearances in 2019 (27-488-18.1, five TDs; 2-39-19.5 punt returns).

","<p>Finesse wideout with good speed and great athleticism who is fully operational on all three levels of the field. Dotson's passing scheme was well-designed and allowed for clear access to space for most of the season. His route-running is smooth but features speed changes and his in-air athleticism and ball skills look effortless. His confidence and competitiveness are just average against physical coverage and he's likely to see a lot more press looks as a pro. Dotson has inside/outside starting talent but a lack of physicality could prevent him from taking over games at the same rate we saw at Penn State.</p>

He muscles throws, hindering his accuracy on drive throws but has adequate arm strength and can expedite off-platform throws. Howell doesn't throw with nearly enough timing or ball placement, which forces wideouts into the boundaries or to break stride, limiting their YAC potential. He flashed impressive dual-threat talent in 2021, which should work in his favor. The 2021 tape was bumpy but his makeup is really good and improvement is likely with better pieces around him.

Shakir was limited in spring 2021 practices after having surgery on a lower body injury, but that did not affect his play in the fall, as he led the Broncos with 77 receptions, 1,117 receiving yards (14.5 per catch) and seven scores in 12 games (11 starts) to once again land first-team all-league honors. He also rushed for 130 yards on 21 carries (6.2 per att.) and returned kickoffs (3-80-26.7) and punts (9-115-12.8). -- by Chad Reuter</p>
","<p>A coach's dream, combining competitive nature, exciting versatility and elite character on and off the field. For a short-armed player with average explosiveness, Shakir puts an emphatic stamp on games. He's more football player than prototypical slot receiver and needs to prove he can handle an increase in contested catches. He can be activated from a variety of alignments with the vision, wiggle and toughness to move the chains once the ball is in his hands. He finds a way to frequently show up on the notepad when watching tape and his will to outperform the guy across from him should not be overlooked. Shakir should become a valuable piece for a creative play-caller.</p>

He stayed close to home, however, to play for offensive-minded head coach Jeff Brohm. Not surprisingly, Bell got on the field immediately for the Boilermakers, starting nine of 12 games played and tying for 10th nationally with 7.2 receptions per game (86-1,035-12.0, seven TDs receiving; 3-12-4.0, one TD rushing in 12 games, nine starts) to earn Freshman All-American, Big Ten Freshman of the Year and honorable mention all-conference accolades. He was again the team's top target in 2020, garnering first-team All-Big Ten notice by scoring eight touchdowns in six starts and tying for fourth in the FBS with 8.8 receptions per game (53-625-11.8). Bell completed his career in West Lafayette as a first-team Associated Press All-American, Big Ten Conference Receiver of the Year and Biletnikoff Award finalist after grabbing 93 receptions for 1,286 yards (13.8 per catch) and six scores to lead his squad over 11 starts.

While the tape has several elements to excite the viewer, the lack of functional explosiveness, speed and change of direction he showed at the NFL Scouting Combine simply can't be ignored. He's a willing worker in the middle of the field and has a savvy element to his game, but he'll have to prove he's better than his testing suggested as a Day 3 prospect.</p>

He played in all 14 games with two starts, though he was suspended for the first half of the Georgia Tech game for violation of team rules and then got into a fight with a Georgia Tech player that cost him the first half of the SEC Championship Game against LSU.

His receiving production greatly increased in 2021 (62-807-13.0, seven TDs) and he shared SEC Special Teams Player of the Year honors with Alabama receiver Jameson Williams as a return specialist (23-628-27.3, one TD kick returns; 18-272-15.1 punt returns). Jones had moved across the country when signing with the Trojans, arriving in Los Angeles after earning first-team all-state honors at Saraland High School in Alabama. As a redshirt freshman, he played in all 14 games as a reserve wideout (6-46-7.7 receiving; 5-15-3.0 rushing) and top kick returner (31-760-24.5). Jones received more work on offense as a sophomore (24-266-11.1, one TD receiving; 6-13-2.2, one TD rushing, four starts in 12 games) while still returning kicks (21-483-23.0). His work as a receiver dropped off in 2019 (6-35-5.8 receiving) but Pac-12 coaches noted his special team contributions by voting him second-team all-conference as a kick returner (29-704-24.3, one TD). -- by Chad Reuter</p>

Despite spending six seasons in college between his time at USC and Tennessee, Jones has very modest production as a wideout, but flashed potential in that area in 2021.

He's not a very fundamentally sound route-runner but might not need to be if teams view him as a catch-and-run specialist in the quick game underneath.

Allgeier was named the 2021 Independence Bowl Offensive Most Valuable Player with 192 rushing yards and three scores in the team's loss to UAB.

Allgeier had a profane anti-cancer theme written on his left shoe vs. Navy in 2020 despite BYU's school code outlawing that language.

Smith had torn an ACL late in his senior season, however, and then tore his other ACL in August 2018, which caused him to redshirt the fall. Former Georgia RB Robert Edwards reached out to White after the 2017 injury, as Edwards' own career was derailed by a knee injury suffered during a Pro Bowl week beach football game. Smith returned for the 2019 season, though, winning the school's David Jacobs Award for overcoming injury by playing in 13 games (78-408-5.2, three TDs rushing; 2-20-10.0 receiving) with one start behind D'Andre Swift and Brian Herrien.

","<p>White is a naturally powerful runner with a lower half that is hard to knock off-balance no matter how clean the shot. He's not very dynamic as a runner but is a two-way creator with lateral jump-cuts to avoid tackles and the power to run through them. He's a wide-base runner who should excel in gap and inside zone schemes but his running style might not lend itself to a long career. He has two ACL tears in his background and is unlikely to play on passing downs, but he's a formidable &quot;thunder&quot; back waiting to be paired with a &quot;lightning&quot; cohort and will give running games a chance to test the resolve of defenses for four full quarters.</p>

Cade's grandfather, Sid, is the state of Washington's all-time leader in high school coaching wins. His father, Tim, coaches at Tumwater High School, where Cade was named Class 2A State Player of the Year as a senior (39-733, 13 TDs receiving; 107 tackles, 10 for loss). His uncle, Brad, played quarterback at USC and his younger brother, Ryan, was offered by Washington in the summer of 2020 to be part of the recruiting class of 2022. Otton redshirted in 2017 and excelled the following fall, earning the team's Freshman of the Year Award after starting 10 of 14 games played (13-174-13.4, three TDs). He started all 13 games as a sophomore, grabbing 32 passes for 344 yards (10.8 per rec.) and two scores. Otton earned first-team All-Pac-12 recognition in 2020, leading the Huskies with 18 receptions, 258 receiving yards (14.3 per rec.) and three scores. His 2021 season did not go as expected, however, as he missed four games (two for COVID protocols, two with a left foot injury) and the team's quarterbacks struggled to get him the ball (28-250-8.9, one TD in eight starts). -- by Chad Reuter</p>
","<p>Four-year starter who will be next up from a program with a history of turning out NFL talent at tight end. Otton is an instinctive route-runner with agile feet in tight quarters and a great feel for changing speeds inside the route. He has sudden, reliable hands, and is skilled and athletic enough to shine against man or zone coverages. As with all UW tight ends, Otton was expected to block for the run game and did so with adequate technique. He will need to bolster his play strength and aggression levels to better execute his blocking itinerary at the next level. He's an ascending combination tight end with starting talent. He should become a more productive pro than college player as a likely Day 2 selection.</p>

He played in all 14 games as a freshman, but he caught just eight passes for 160 yards (20.0 per) and three scores. His final catch of the year, though, was the national title game-winner from fellow freshman Tua Tagovailoa in overtime. The Louisiana native started 10 of 14 games played as a sophomore, becoming a regular target for Tagovailoa, with 42 catches for 693 yards (16.5 per) and six touchdowns. In 2019, Smith was a second-team Associated Press All-American and second-team all-SEC selection. He led the Tide with 1,256 receiving yards and 14 touchdowns (on 68 catches, 18.5 per), including an 11-catch performance for a school-record 274 yards and five scores against Ole Miss. His decision to return for 2020 paid off in a major way. &quot;Smitty&quot; won the Heisman Trophy as well as the Biletnikoff and Walter Camp Player of the Year Awards. He was a first-team Associated Press All-American and the SEC Offensive Player of the Year (and first-team all-conference). Smith led the FBS with 23 receiving touchdowns, which put him fifth in the career all-time list nationally (46 in four years) and first in the SEC annals. He also led the country in receptions (117) and receiving yards (1,856). He became the record-holder in career receiving yards in the SEC. Smith also returned 11 punts for 237 yards (21.5 per) and a score but did not qualify for the FBS leaderboard. Smith finished the year strong, earning MVP of the College Football Playoff semifinal win over Notre Dame (seven receptions, 130 yards, three TDs) and then excelling in the first half of the national title game (12 receptions, 215 yards, three TDs) against Ohio State before going to the sideline with a dislocated finger. He accepted an invitation to the Senior Bowl but did not participate in practices or the game due to the injury. -- by Chad Reuter</p>
","<p>While Atlanta Falcons WR Calvin Ridley is my NFL comparison for Smith, I feel like a better comp might be Golden State Warriors superstar Steph Curry. Like Curry, Smith is thinner than you'd like and isn't the strongest player, but he has rare quickness, speed, and change-of-direction fluidity, and he creates separation from defenders seemingly at will. He possesses an elite skill level for the position and can hit the defense from short, mid-range or deep. Smith has quietly been the most complete of the receivers at Alabama over the last two seasons and will give an NFL team the ability to mismatch him against the weak links either inside or outside in coverage. He's a detailed route runner with the athletic ability to really make them count, from a separation standpoint, and his ball skills are unquestioned. Smith has the football character, athletic gifts and upper-echelon skill level to become a long-time starter and Pro Bowl regular.</p>

Pitts committed to Florida and got on the field for 11 games as a reserve in 2018, catching three passes for 73 yards (24.3 per) and a score. His sophomore campaign was outstanding, as he led the Gators with 54 catches for 649 yards (12.0 per) and scored five times in 13 games (12 starts) to earn first-team All-SEC accolades. Pitts became a superstar in 2020, winning the John Mackey award (top TE) and earning Associated Press first-team All-American honors. He was also the first tight end to be named a Fred Biletnikoff award (top WR) finalist after catching 43 passes for 770 yards (17.9 per) and 12 receiving touchdowns (tied for third-most in the FBS) in eight starts. Pitts missed three games due to a concussion/facial injury and decided not to play in Florida's bowl game. -- by Chad Reuter</p>
","<p>While the player comparison for the purposes of this scouting report is Darren Waller, Pitts may have the traits and talent to create mismatches similar to those created by Calvin Johnson and Tyreek Hill. His rare blend of size, athleticism and ball skills are reminiscent of Megatronâs. His ability as a pass-catching tight end could force defenses in his division to alter the way they construct their roster. Heâs a tough matchup for most linebackers and too big for most cornerbacks. He offers offensive coordinators the ability to align him all over the field and, like Waller, can become a highly targeted, highly productive pass catcher from the tight end position. He puts in effort as a blocker but with limited success. Thatâs not what makes him special, though. Along with Clemson QB Trevor Lawrence, Pitts has a chance to become the biggest game-changer in the 2021 NFL Draft.</p>

Chase led the FBS and set SEC records with 1,780 receiving yards and 20 receiving touchdowns (on 84 receptions) in 14 starts. As a true freshman in 2018, Chase started seven of 13 games (23 receptions, 313 yards, 13.6 average, three touchdowns), including the final five contests.

","<p>We could sit here and talk about the marginal route-running issues or challenges getting off press. However, Chase is supremely talented as a ball winner and playmaker. After all, routes and release can be coached. He had some issues when Trevon Diggs and Cameron Dantzler gave hard jams to his release in 2019, so that will need to be addressed. His burst is effortless, which tends to catch coverage off guard when he really hits the vertical gas. His competitive nature and play strength simply act as multipliers for his outstanding ball skills. He hasn't played football since very early in 2020 and still has work to do, but he should be an early starter and a future Pro Bowler.</p>

Harris eschewed the NFL to return to Alabama in 2020, helping the Tide win another national title and also winning the Doak Walker Award as the nation's top back as well as first-team All-SEC honors.

He appeared in 12 games as a true freshman, playing behind Jake Fromm (27-of-39, 69.2%, 328 yards, four TDs passing; 42-266-6.3, four TDs rushing) and earning a spot on the SEC All-Freshman Team. He decided to move on to Ohio State in January 2019, as Fromm was expected to start again that year. Fields was granted a waiver from the NCAA that allowed him to play immediately for the Buckeyes. He earned Heisman Trophy finalist, second-team Associated Press All-American and Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year honors as a sophomore, ranking third in the country in touchdown throws (41, against just three interceptions) and fourth in passing efficiency rating (181.4) in 14 starts. He was named MVP of the Big Ten Championship Game after throwing for 299 yards and three TDs in a win over Wisconsin before losing to Clemson in the national semifinals. Fields was quite familiar with Tigers quarterback Trevor Lawrence as they grew up 20 miles apart in Georgia and were considered the top two prospects in the 2018 recruiting class. Fields took Ohio State a step closer to a national title in 2020, winning Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year for the second straight season. He finished the year ranked sixth in the country in completion percentage (158-of-225, 70.2%, 2,100 yards, 22 TDs, six INTs passing) and rushed for five scores (81-383-4.7) in eight starts. His postseason efforts as a passer were up and down. He struggled against Northwestern in the team's Big Ten Championship Game victory (12-of-27, 44.4%, 114 yards, 2 INTs), bounced back while playing through injury in the semifinal win over Clemson (22-of-28, 78.6%, 385 yards, six TDs, one INT), and then came up short against Alabama in the title game (17-of-33, 51.5%, 194 yards, one TD). Fields' father, Ivant, played football at Eastern Kentucky. -- by Chad Reuter</p>
","<p>Like Dak Prescott before him, Fields enters the league with dual-threat capabilities but is more of a pocket passer with the ability to extend plays or win with his legs when needed. He was up and down in 2020, but a bounce-back performance against Clemson -- including an impressive second half after suffering an injury -- said a lot about his toughness and leadership. He sees the field fairly well inside the Buckeyesâ quarterback-friendly offense but needs to become a full-field reader and prevent his eyes from becoming transfixed on primary targets. He sticks open throws with accuracy and velocity thanks to a sturdy platform and good drive mechanics. Heâs also comfortable throwing into intermediate holes of a zone. A slower operation time and a lack of a twitchy trigger will require him to work with better anticipation and pressure recognition pre- and post-snap. He takes more sacks than coaches will be comfortable with but he also digs his way out of holes and creates explosive plays. Fields operates with a quiet confidence and has experience overcoming adversity. He should continue to improve and become a solid NFL starter within a couple of seasons.</p>

It did not take long for him to become a factor in the Rebels' offense, starting four of 12 games as a true freshman (36 receptions, 398 yards, 11.1 average, two touchdowns) and also contributing as a returner (12 kick returns, 222 yards, 18.5 average; 10 punt returns, 34 yards, 3.4 average). Moore led the team in receiving in 2019, grabbing 67 passes for 850 yards (12.7 per) and six scores. He also returned 14 punts for 90 yards (6.4 per) but might have been best known for infamously celebrating his touchdown catch with just four seconds remaining catch against rival Mississippi State by mimicking a urinating dog in the end zone. His celebration drew a 15-yard personal foul penalty, which pushed back an extra point attempt that was no good and allowed MSU to win the annual Egg Bowl by one point. Moore made national headlines for the right reasons in 2020, leading the FBS with 10.8 receptions and 149.1 receiving yards per game. He set a school record with 86 receptions (breaking current Tennessee Titans receiver A.J. Brown's record) for 1,193 yards and eight scores. Moore also rushed for 64 yards on 14 attempts (4.6 per) in his eight starts on his way to first-team Associated Press All-American, first-team All-SEC and Biletnikoff Award finalist honors. He opted out of the remainder of the season after eight games. -- by Chad Reuter</p>

He's not very big, but he's stronger than his measurables might suggest and he's shown a fearlessness to make the catch despite impending punishment. Moore has the short-area quickness to snap off crisp routes underneath for separation and the play speed to challenge over the top as well as work the deep middle. He has soft, sure hands and above-average ball skills with a great feel for spatial awareness to hit the sweet spots when working against zone. While longer, more physical cornerbacks could slow him a little bit in the NFL, his athletic profile and playing demeanor should lead evaluators to believe he will be a very good pro early in his career.</p>

The 2017 Kentucky Gatorade Player of the Year helped his school win a state title before heading to West Lafayette. He won the Paul Hornung Award as a true freshman as the nation's most versatile college football player. Moore led the FBS with 114 receptions, tied for eighth with 12 receiving and also contributed as a rusher (21 carries, 213 yards, 10.1 yards per carry, two touchdowns), kick returner (33 returns, 662 yards, 20.1 average) and punt returner (12 returns, 62 yards, 5.2 average) in 13 games (10 starts). He was a consensus first-team All-American as an all-purpose player, first-team all-conference pick, the Big Ten Wide Receiver of the Year and its Freshman of the Year.

He initially opted out of the 2020 season due to COVID-19 but decided to opt back in when the Big Ten announced it would have a fall football season instead of playing in the spring. Moore was named honorable mention all-conference in 2020 despite starting in just three games (35 receptions, 270 yards, 7.7 average; six carries, 32 yards, 5.3 yards per carry, one TD). -- by Chad Reuter</p>
","<p>Slightly undersized slot receiver who makes up for it with above-average strength and competitive fire that shows up throughout the tape. He can beat one-on-one coverage with speed but lacks the size and length to legitimately challenge NFL cornerbacks outside. He's difficult to press, elusive out of route breaks underneath and his ability after the catch could make him a priority target when it's time to move the sticks on third down. He lacks desired game experience on paper, but he's the same player week in and week out and teams know exactly what they will get with him. His football character and acumen are big pluses to go with his talent. Moore should become a good starting slot target with punt return potential.</p>

His father, Mike, played defensive tackle at Utah under current Utes head coach Kyle Whittingham (who was then the D-line coach), but they already had a quarterback recruited for the 2018 class. So, Wilson signed with arch-rival BYU and started seven of nine games played as a true freshman (120-of-182, 65.9% completion rate, 1,578 yards, 12 TDs, three INTs passing; 75-211-2.9, two TDs rushing), finishing the season with a Famous Idaho Potato Bowl MVP effort (18-of-18, 317 yards, four TDs). He underwent right (throwing) shoulder surgery after the season for an injury he suffered in high school. He started nine games (199-of-319, 62.4%, 2,382 yards, 11 TDs, 9 INTs passing; 67-167-2.5, 3 TDs rushing) in 2019 but missed time with a fractured right thumb that required surgery. Wilson broke out in 2020, sharing the Polynesian Player of the Year Award with USC safety Talanoa Hufanga. He ranked second in the FBS in completion percentage (247 of 336; 73.5%), third with 33 passing touchdowns (against just three interceptions) and 10th with 307.7 passing yards per game (3,692 total).

","<p>Ascending quarterback prospect who possesses the swagger and arm talent to create explosive plays inside and outside the pocket. The gunslingerâs mentality and improvised release points are clearly patterned off of one of his favorite players, Aaron Rodgers. However, his play is a little more reminiscent of a blend between Jake Plummer and Johnny Manziel coming out of college. As with Manziel, too much of Wilsonâs work comes off-schedule due to inconsistent anticipation and a desire to hit the big play. But like both Manziel (at Texas A&amp;M) and Plummer, heâs mobile with the ability to extend plays and hit the chunk play. Wilsonâs sophomore year tape shows troubling decision-making, so NFL teams will need to balance his 2019 and 2020 production in the evaluation process. Heâs put in a lot of work to get to this point and has the potential to become a good pro. However, he might need to play with a more disciplined approach to reach his ceiling.</p>

Waddle was part of one of the best receiving corps in college football history in 2019.

North Carolina coaches kept him in-state, and then provided some playing time his true freshman season (43 carries, 224 yards, 5.2 yards per carry, five TDs; eight receptions, 58 yards, 7.3 average). He started once in 13 appearances in 2019, rushing for 933 yards and five scores on 166 carries (5.6 per) while also catching 17 passes for 176 yards (10.4) and a TD. He and teammate Michael Carter formed the top running back duo in the country in 2020. Williams was named second-team Associated Press All-American and second-team All-ACC as a junior despite starting only once in 11 contests. He ranked third in the FBS with 19 rushing TDs, sixth with 1,140 rushing yards, and ninth by averaging 7.3 yards on his 157 carries. Williams also caught 25 passes for 305 yards (12.2 per) and three scores while fumbling only once during the year. The dynamic duo set an NCAA record against Miami, rushing for a total of 544 rushing yards between them (236 for Williams, 308 for Carter). Williams joined Carter and others in not suiting up for the team's bowl game to prepare for the NFL draft. -- by Chad Reuter</p>
","<p>Big, broad bully back who runs with an exciting blend of animosity and feel as a future every-down starter in the league. With just 366 carries under his collegiate belt, Williams hasn't seen much tread come off the tires, but teams might speculate that his running style could lead to some in-season wear and tear. He's a terror behind his pads, creating yardage by battering and discarding tackle attempts. He sees the front fairly well and has above-average hips and the creativity to add to his rush total with more than just power. He lacks run-away speed for the long touchdowns but runs with above-average vision and contact balance to succeed at a high rate near the goal line. He tends to trust the blocking scheme and keep his runs on track but can recalibrate when needed. Williams is best-suited to gap, power and inside zone rather than flowing wide, where he lacks one-cut quickness. He will drop passes from time to time but has the route-running and protection toughness to take over as a three-down RB1 fairly early in his career.</p>

The Jacksonville native redshirted his first year with the Tide while Tua was helping the team win a national title. Jones was arrested and charged with DUI in November of that year after being involved in a car accident. He served a suspension against LSU. He played in 14 games as a reserve the following season (5 of 13, 38.5 completion percentage, 123 yards, one touchdown). Jones began the year behind Tua in 2019 but took over (97 of 141, 68.8%, 1,503 yards, 14 TDs, three interceptions; 16 carries, 36 yards, 2.3 average, one TD in four starts, 12 appearances overall) once the 2020 first-round pick was shut down due to injury. Jones led the team to a Citrus Bowl win over Michigan, throwing for 327 yards and three TDs. Jones continued his progress as a passer in 2020, starting all 13 games to lead Alabama to another title. He set an FBS record for single-season completion percentage (311 of 402, 77.4%) and led the country with a school-record 4,500 passing yards while ranking second with 41 passing TDs and 11.2 yards per attempt. The first-team Associated Press All-American and all-conference selection won the Davey O'Brien Award as the nation's top quarterback and was a finalist for the Heisman Trophy as well as the Maxwell and Walter Camp Player of the Year awards. He was also named the SEC Student-Athlete of the Year and the Offensive MVP of the national title game (36 of 45, 80.0%, 464 yards, five TDs). He accepted an invitation to the Senior Bowl. Jones' mother played tennis at Mercer, his father played tennis at Florida State, his sister played tennis at the College of Charleston and his brother played soccer at Mercer. -- by Chad Reuter</p>
","<p>Jones has above-average accuracy and a season full of eye-catching production. He displayed nice improvement as he grew into the position from 2019 to 2020. His accuracy and ball placement stand out and he throws a very catchable football with consistent touch on it. He's not much of an improv player but can hurt defenses with his feet once he leaves the pocket. The tape shows too much predetermined decision-making about where he wants to go with the football rather than letting the coverage and his progressions speak to him. While the production looks great, he has clearly benefited from a wealth of riches up front, in the backfield and at wide receiver. He has a tendency to play with some panic when pressure gets after him and could struggle when things aren't optimal around him. Jones has good backup to low-end starter potential.</p>

Bateman plays with pro-ready hands and the upper-body agility needed to adjust in air and bring the ball in.

He won two state titles in the 200-meter dash and one in the 100-meter dash during his high school career. As a true freshman in 2017, he played in 12 games as a reserve (17 receptions, 121 yards, 7.1 average, one touchdown; six carries, 60 yards). He started all 12 contests in 2017 (30 receptions, 506 yards, 16.9 average, three touchdowns; four carries, 13 yards) and seven of 11 games at receiver in 2018 (38 receptions, 776 yards, 20.4 average, three touchdowns). Eskridge started two games at receiver and cornerback for the Broncos in 2019 (four receptions, 51 yards, 12.8 average; 14 tackles, four pass breakups), partially because NFL scouts thought it could be good for him to get experience on defense because of his stature. His season was cut short after suffering a clavicle injury in Week 4, however, so he redshirted. Eskridge returned to a receiver role full-time in 2020, garnering first-team All-MAC honors on offense and as a kick returner while also being named the MAC Special Teams Player of the Year. He led the FBS with 213 all-purpose yards per game (one carry, 27 yards; 17 kick returns, 467 yards, 27.5 average, one touchdown) and ranked fourth with 130.7 receiving yards per game and 23.1 yards per reception (34 receptions, 784 yards, eight touchdowns).

","<p>He's not a great route-runner, will struggle with contested catches and lacks desired size, but he can really fly and has home run potential from anywhere on the field. Eskridge is a linear route-runner with good tempo when working down the field but will need a more limited route tree featuring crossing routes, slants, posts and over routes so he can rely on his speed rather than route-running. He can rise up and get the tall throws but catching through contact is where he is likely to struggle. He has gadget potential in the quick game and is a potentially dangerous kick returner, but his biggest selling point might be as a field stretcher from the slot.</p>

Despite missing three games with a fractured toe, he was a major factor for the national champs as a sophomore, catching 46 passes for 671 yards (14.6 per) and 13 scores. Marshall, Ja'Marr Chase and Justin Jefferson each caught more than 10 TDs for LSU in 2019. He started the first seven games of the 2020 season, leading the team in receiving during that time (48 receptions, 731 yards, 15.2 average, 10 TDs), before opting out for the remainder of the campaign. He is the great nephew of the late Joe Delaney, a talented NFL running back who drowned in 1983 trying to rescue three children at the bottom of a pond. -- by Chad Reuter</p>
","<p>Big, fast and talented, Marshall has the ingredients to become a solid starter in the league but has some questions to answer. With the departure of Justin Jefferson and with Ja'Marr Chase opting out, more targets and more shaded coverage ended up coming his way until he opted out at the end of November. He looks much more comfortable outside than he does in the slot, and he's a more reliable ball-catcher when he's working the second and third levels. He's a natural ball-tracker with a second gear and the catch radius to go get it, and his size gives him an advantage on 50-50 balls. For all of his talent, Marshall seemed disinterested at times in 2020 and wasn't always committed to finishing his routes or running them with consistent intensity. There are traits and talent at his disposal, but the difference between becoming a WR2 and a WR3/4 could be determined by how hard he's willing to work at his craft.</p>

Hubbard became the top workhorse in the country as a redshirt sophomore, leading the FBS with 328 carries and 2,094 rushing yards (a healthy 6.4 per) and tying for third with 21 rushing touchdowns (also 23 receptions, 198 yards, 8.6 average). He garnered first-team Associated Press All-American, Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year and first-team all-conference accolades in addition to being named a finalist for the Walter Camp Player of the Year and Doak Walker Awards. In June 2020, Hubbard threatened to boycott team activities because OSU head coach Mike Gundy wore a T-shirt with the logo of the One America News Network, which is known as a far-right outlet. Gundy apologized to players later that week and committed to making changes. Hubbard started the first seven games of the 2020 season, garnering a second-team All-Big 12 nod despite a considerable drop in production (133 carries, 625 yards, 4.7 yards per carry, five touchdowns; eight receptions, 52 yards, 6.5 average, one touchdown). The Allstate AFCA Good Works Team honoree was sidelined with an ankle injury late in the year, however, and opted out of the team's last two games to prepare for the NFL draft. -- by Chad Reuter</p>
","<p>Hubbard's 2019 production would tell you he ate, but he had plenty put on his plate with almost 26 carries per game. In 2020, his production dipped as teams seemed to find ways to bottle him up. Hubbard is a tempo-driven runner as an outside-zone back playing peek-a-boo behind his blocks. His willingness to get upfield rather than bounce everything will be applauded, but he needs to use his vision and easy change of direction to become more creative on the second level as a pro. He needs to tighten up his ball security issues, but has the talent to become a committee back with upside for a zone-based rushing attack.</p>

He enrolled a semester early and became an immediate contributor, starting three of 14 games played (121 carries, 744 yards, 6.1 yards per carry, five touchdowns; 16 receptions, 139 yards, 8.7 average, two touchdowns).

Injuries limited him in 2019, however, and he could only play in nine games with four starts (54 carries, 385 yards, 7.1 yards per carry, four touchdowns; eight receptions, 71 yards, 8.9 average, one touchdown). He transferred to Ohio State after the season; the Buckeyes were in the hunt for his services in the recruiting process out of high school. He rushed 116 times for 870 yards and four touchdowns (12 receptions, 95 yards, 7.9 average in eight games, two starts) in 2020. He came on strong at the end of the year, rushing for 331 yards in the Big Ten Championship Game and 193 yards in the College Football Playoff semifinal against Clemson (adding four receptions for 61 yards). Unfortunately, Sermon only carried once in the national title game before a shoulder injury sidelined him. He accepted an invitation to the Senior Bowl but was not able to participate in practices or the game due to the injury. -- by Chad Reuter</p>
","<p>Great-looking running back at a quick glance, but one who suffers from inconsistency in creativity and decisiveness. The regular-season tape at Ohio State was fairly disappointing relative to the talent he showed at Oklahoma, but his monster postseason should quell some concerns. At both schools, the interior vision and decision-making was suspect and would run him into some traffic. He does have potential as an outside-zone back, where he has more time and space to utilize his skills. He has size and open-field speed and will step up and handle his business in pass protection, as well as catch it out of the backfield. So, while Sermon's skill level as a runner is somewhat average, his potential as a three-down backup with upside should create middle-round interest.</p>

He was part of a historic regular season finale that season, as A&amp;M beat LSU 74-72 in seven overtimes. Mond again started all 13 games as a junior, completing 61.6 percent of his throws (258 of 419) for 2,897 yards, 20 touchdowns and nine interceptions. He also scored eight touchdowns on the ground (126 carries, 500 yards, 4.0 yards per carry) and won the Texas Bowl MVP Award (95 passing yards, one touchdown; 119 rushing yards, one touchdown). Mond became A&amp;M's all-time leader in most career passing categories and tied Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel with 93 total touchdowns after leading the team to a 9-1 finish as a 10-game starter in 2020 (188 of 297, 63.3 completion percentage, 2,282 yards, 19 touchdowns, three interceptions; 74 carries, 294 yards, 4.0 yards per carry, four touchdowns).

","<p>Quarterback with dual-threat physical tools who has grown and matured into a role as a confident game manager. The Aggies' offense asked too much of Mond in the past, which led to diminishing returns. However, the 2020 offense featured a strong rushing attack paired with play-action, where he not only found greater confidence and rhythm as a passer, but also noticeable pocket poise and accuracy. He doesn't often get antsy working from the pocket and throws with solid ball placement underneath. Issues with touch and anticipation create erratic completion numbers when asked to throw down the field and outside the numbers, which will concern evaluators. His zone-read talent and quick release to incorporate RPOs adds to his draft value, but he might lack the consistency to ever become more than a solid backup.</p>

He decided to move from Knoxville to Clemson, however, as a top-100 national recruit and two-time Tennessee Mr. Football Award winner. Rodgers played in 14 games as a true freshman (19 receptions, 123 yards, 6.5 average; two punt returns, 15 yards, 7.5 average) before moving into the starting lineup for all 15 games during the team's national championship season. He garnered honorable mention All-ACC honors as an all-purpose player in 2018 (55 receptions, 575 yards, 10.5 average, four touchdowns; 39 punt returns, 299 yards, 7.7 average, one touchdown). Rodgers suffered a torn ACL the following March but only missed one game of his junior year (10 starts in 14 appearances) to garner honorable mention all-conference accolades as a receiver (30 receptions, 426 yards, 14.2 average, four touchdowns) and all-purpose player (18 punt returns, 151 yards, 8.4 average, two rushes, 50 yards, one touchdown). With the departure of Tee Higgins and the loss of Justyn Ross due to injury, Rodgers became Trevor Lawrence's top target in 2020, leading the Tigers with 77 receptions and 1,020 receiving yards (13.3 per) while tying for the team lead with seven touchdown catches. The first-team All-ACC selection also scored once as a rusher (2-50-25.0) and returned punts (nine returns, 64 yards, 7.1 average). He accepted an invitation to the Senior Bowl. -- by Chad Reuter</p>
","<p>Compact slot target who thrived at Clemson with his ability to create chunk plays out of short catch-and-runs and take the top off defenses with his speed. Rodgers has a running back's stout lower body, providing power and balance to break tackles and rumble through contact with the ball in his hands. His ball skills are pretty good, but he can go from magnificent catch to focus drop in a single drive. Rodgers uses speed alterations inside the route and a sudden burst to top speed to create deep separation from coverage. He's not as effective at separating underneath against tight man coverage and will need to prove himself in that regard.</p>

But when head coach Mike Sanford left to become the offensive coordinator at Notre Dame, the quarterback switched his commitment to play for Mike Leach at Washington State. However, Book ultimately joined Sanford in South Bend instead (though the coach was only in town for one year before taking the head coaching job at Western Kentucky). Book made a name for himself in Notre Dame lore by coming off the bench to lead the Irish to a win over LSU in the Citrus Bowl his redshirt freshman season. He played in 10 games with one start that season (46-of-75, 61.3 completion percentage, 456 yards, four touchdowns, four interceptions passing; 37 carries, 207 yards, 5.6 yards per carry).

He started all 13 games as a junior, winning the team's Offensive Player of the Year by being one of just two FBS quarterbacks (Oklahoma's Jalen Hurts) to exceed 2,500 passing yards, 30 touchdown passes and 500 rushing yards (240 of 399, 60.2 completion percentage, 3,039 yards, 34 touchdowns, six interceptions; 110 carries, 567 yards, 5.2 yards per carry, four touchdowns). Book took his team to new heights in 2020, leading Notre Dame to the College Football Playoff and garnering third-team All-ACC honors while becoming the winningest quarterback in school history (30-5 record, 15-0 at home) and ranking second all-time behind Brady Quinn in passing yards (8,953) and touchdowns (72). The two-time team captain completed 64.6 percent of his passes (228 of 353) for 2,829 yards and 15 touchdowns against just three interceptions, also running for nine touchdowns (116 carries, 485 yards, 4.2 yards per carry).

","<p>Notre Dame's winningest quarterback brings plenty of leadership and overall intangibles with him. He has big game experience in his background, too. However, his size and arm strength fall below NFL standards and there isn't anything in his game that he can really hang his hat on that counters those issues. He makes receivers work too hard for the catch and was dreadful throwing outside the numbers in 2020. He's effective in RPO calls. He also does a nice job of feeling pocket pressure and sliding around it or getting outside the pocket to make plays.

In Year 2, he was the Big Ten Return Specialist of the Year and his team's Special Teams Most Valuable Player, filling up the stat sheet even more (24-707-29.5 on kick returns; 23-361-15.7, three TDs receiving; 9-71-7.9 rushing). Prior to the 2019 campaign, Smith-Marsette actually promised that he would return a kickoff for a touchdown -- and made good with one in the regular-season finale, then added another in the team's bowl game. He was named honorable mention All-Big Ten pick after leading his squad in receiving yards and scores (44-722-16.4, five TDs), while continuing to contribute as a runner (11-108-9.8, two TDs) and kick returner (17-503-29.6). This past season, Smith-Marsette nabbed honorable mention All-Big Ten accolades for his work as a receiver (25-345-13.8, four TDs receiving; 7-54-7.7, one TD rushing) and kick returner (8-176-22.0).

","<p>The lack of urgency and inconsistencies as a big pass catcher can be maddening during tape study.

Despite some of the flashes and his overall potential, he doesn't have the field demeanor of a player with an NFL-caliber competitive streak. His physical traits are certainly worthy of a Day 3 selection, but he needs to play with more passion if he wants to make it as a long-term pro.</p>

Dez was a four-star recruit himself after earning finalist honors for Michigan High School Player of the Year in 2015 (23 receiving touchdowns, seven interceptions, 12 pass breakups). As a redshirt freshman, Fitzpatrick started eight of 13 games played, garnering honorable mention All-ACC honors with 45 receptions for 699 yards (15.5 per) and nine touchdowns while catching passes from Heisman Trophy winner Lamar Jackson. With Jackson off to the NFL the following year, Fitzpatrick's numbers dropped a bit (31 receptions, 422 yards, 13.6 average, three touchdowns in 12 games, six starts). He bounced back as a junior, averaging 18.1 yards per catch (35 receptions, 635 yards) and scoring six times.

Darby was named ASU's Co-Scout Team Offensive Player of the Year during his 2016 redshirt season.

","<p>Good size and speed but a scouting report filled with ball-skill concerns.

His top-end speed will create cushions and open up some intermediate throws for him, but the route-running still needs work. The biggest concern is that he really struggles to secure throws outside his frame. Catching the football is the name of the game, so the speed might land him on a roster, but he needs to improve his basic ball skills to stick around.</p>

He was replaced by freshman Tua Tagovailoa in the second half of the team's title game victory over Clemson, however.

Hurts decided to transfer from Alabama to Oklahoma as a graduate student for 2019 and interestingly, has the same birth date (Aug. 7) as the quarterback that he replaced at OU, Kyler Murray. He did not disappoint during his lone year in Norman, leading the team to Big 12 title and playoff appearances while garnering third-team Associated Press All-American Big 12 Offensive Newcomer of the Year, and first-team all-conference honors.

Hurts is a more accurate passer and better runner than Tebow but is inconsistent as a decision-maker and tends to break the pocket when throws are there to be made. His deep-ball touch and intermediate accuracy improved this year so teams may see him as a developmental talent who will keep getting better in the right scheme.

He only completed 59.4 percent of his passes, however (240 of 404). Herbert's athleticism allows him to make plays with his legs a few times per game (173 carries for 510 yards and nine scores in his first three years). Herbert was an Academic All-American at Oregon. In fact, he was named the Academic All-American of the Year in 2019. His play on the field in 14 starts (286-of-428 passing, 66.8 percent completion rate, 3,471 yards, 32 TDs, six INTs) earned him honorable mention All-Pac-12 accolades.

He repeated Baker Mayfield's accomplishment in 2018, winning the same trophy after an outstanding junior season. The first-team Associated Press All-American and Player of the Year, Davey O'Brien Award winner, Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year and finalist for the Maxwell Award played in all 14 games with 13 starts (he did not start against Baylor because he was late for practice). He ranked in the top five nationally in passing efficiency (199.2), passing yardage (4,361), passing touchdowns (42, against just seven interceptions), and rushing yardage by a quarterback (123-1,001-7.3, 12 TD). He became the second quarterback in FBS history (Deshaun Watson, 2015) to throw for 4,000 yards and rush for 1,000 yards. Murray signed with Texas A&M out of high school, following his dad's footsteps to play quarterback there (Kevin set many school passing records there in the mid 1980s). Kyler was a five-star recruit and top 50 overall prospect from Allen High School in Texas who went 43-0 as a starter, totaled 14,500 yards of offense, and won the National Gatorade Player of the Year after his senior year from multiple outlets. He played in eight games for the Aggies as a true freshman, making three starts (72-121-59.5, 686 yards, five TD, seven INT passing; 53-335-6.3 rushing). After the season, he joined fellow passer Kyle Allen in transferring out of a struggling Texas A&M program. He decided on Oklahoma, sitting out the 2016 season there as a redshirt. Murray played in seven games behind Mayfield in 2017, starting one contest (18-21-85.7, 359 yards, three TD, no INT). He was the ninth overall pick in the 2018 Major League Baseball amateur draft, selected by the Oakland A's, who presented him with about $5 million in signing bonus. Murray played outfield and hit cleanup for the Sooners' baseball team in 2017, batting .296 with 10 homers and 47 RBI. Murray's dad played minor league ball, as well, and his uncle, Calvin, played outfield in the majors.","Severely undersized, one-year starter with rare playmaking talent that could force general managers to reassess long-held notions about size and style for a franchise quarterback. Murray is like a complex burgundy with notes of Baker Mayfield, Johnny Manziel and Russell Wilson in his play, but like any quarterback, he'll need to prove he can recognize disguised coverages and work on-time from the pocket to go from flash talent to playoff winner. Teams drafting him need to have the right coordinator and must be committed to framing their offense specifically to Murray's strengths and weaknesses, which could require additional roster re-configuration. Murray is an electric talent with a live arm, good mental makeup and the skill-set to produce at a high level in the right offense.","""He's a special athlete, but it takes more than that.

Jones started 11 games in 2018, missing two with a broken clavicle. He completed 60.5 percent of his passes (237-392) for 2,674 yards, 22 touchdowns, and nine interceptions on the year while rushing for 319 yards and three scores.

He went to Northwest Mississippi Community College out of high school, leading the team to a junior college national championship (223-367-60.8, 3,288 yards, 28 TD, five INT) with a big effort in the title game (421 yards, five TD). East Carolina signed him after that season, but he could not lock down the starting job at the start of either of his seasons there. Minshew stepped in for two games for injured Phillip Nelson in 2016 (119-202-58.9, 1,347 yards, eight TD, four INT in seven games) and in five games for an injured Thomas Sirk in 2017 (174-304-57.2, 2,140, 16 TD, seven INT in 10 games).

Works around arm limitations by throwing early and with great placement. Accuracy and ball placement is remarkably consistent. Owns the back-shoulder throw and can wear out cornerbacks with it. Drops perfectly thrown balls into deep buckets with rare accuracy and touch. Unfazed by additional rushers and willing to stand in and deliver.,Below-average height for an NFL quarterback. High number of batted passes with more likely to come in the pros. Benefitted from scheme that allowed an abundance of one-on-ones. Scouts are concerned by perceived lack of arm strength.

Mayfield completed 70.5 percent of his passes (285-of-404), throwing 43 touchdowns against just six interceptions (also rushing for 311 yards and five scores). The Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year led the nation in pass efficiency by a large margin (setting a NCAA record that he himself set the previous year) and yards per pass attempt (11.8), and finished in the top five of pretty much every other passing category. He was an all-state pick from Texas, but his lack of size scared major college programs away. He began his college days in Lubbock, walking on at Texas Tech. In his one and only season there, Mayfield started seven of eight games played, winning Big 12 Offensive Freshman of the Year (218-of-340, 64.1 percent complete, 2,315 yards, 12 touchdowns, nine interceptions). Tech head coach Kliff Kingsbury decided to open up the starting competition, so Mayfield left campus to find a new home. He sat out the 2014 season as a transfer student to Oklahoma (eventually, Big 12 coaches approved a rule that gave Mayfield an extra year of eligibility to make up for the lost season, as he was a walk-on that never received a scholarship offer from Tech). Finally on the field as the No. 1 starter in 2015, Mayfield became a second-team Associated Press All-American, Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year, finished fourth in Heisman Trophy voting, and was a finalist for the Davey O'Brien, Manning, and Walter Camp Player of the Year Awards. He also won the Burlsworth Trophy as the nation's top player who began his career as a walk-on after completing 68.1 percent of his passes (269-of-395) for 3,700 yards and 36 touchdowns against just seven interceptions. In addition to winning Burlsworth Trophy again in 2016, Mayfield was first-team All-Big 12, finished third in Heisman voting, and was a finalist for the Maxwell and Davey O'Brien Awards after leading the FBS in passing efficiency (196.4 rating, ranked first with 70.9 completion percentage, 3,965 yards, 40 touchdowns, eight interceptions). While his completion percentage was aided by horizontal throws, his mobility helped him find secondary targets and his ability to throw passes over the top of defenses also led him to lead the FBS with 11.1 yards per attempt. Mayfield was arrested for public intoxication, disorderly conduct, and fleeing/resisting arrest in February 2017. He was not suspended for those actions, though he was required to participate in alcohol education classes and community service.","Spread quarterbacks have had limited success as have small quarterbacks. Mayfield falls into both categories and has to prove he can transcend those perceived deficiencies on the next level. Having complete command of the Oklahoma offense isn't an automatic precursor for NFL success, but Mayfield's ability to process, extend plays and throw with accuracy give him a good shot. He'll be somewhat scheme-dependent so whoever takes him will need to be willing to build their offense around his strengths.",,Doug Flutie,Tough and competitive.

Jackson's father, Lamar, Sr., passed away in a car accident when Lamar was young, but even throughout the Heisman Trophy-winning 2016 season, Lamar and his mother, Felicia Jones, limited their media exposure. Of course, Jackson got plenty of exposure during his sophomore season, not only winning the Heisman but also Davey O'Brien and Maxwell Awards, as well as the ACC Player of the Year. Jackson's vision and speed as a runner helped him set a school record with 1,571 rushing yards (ranked 10th in the FBS) and 21 touchdowns on 260 carries. His cannon arm helped him pass for 3,543 yards (230-of-409, 56.2 completion percentage) for 30 touchdowns against nine interceptions. Jackson struggled throwing in the team's final three games, all losses (48 completion percentage, three touchdowns, three interceptions). Jackson played well in his junior season, as well, finishing third in the Heisman voting and earning second-team AP All-American, ACC Offensive Player of the Year, and first-team all-conference honors. He completed 59.1 percent of his passes (254-of-430) for 3,660 yards, 27 touchdowns, and 10 interceptions (four in the team's bowl loss to Mississippi State). Jackson also ran for 1,601 yards and 18 touchdowns (both in the top 10 nationally) on 232 carries, while finishing atop the FCS with 405 yards of total offense per game. In his first season with the Cardinals, Jackson started nine of 12 games (once at running back, against Auburn). His performance against Texas A&M in the Music City Bowl at the end of the year portended his future play, as he ran and threw for over 200 yards on his way to Most Valuable Player honors.","Evaluating Jackson against the NFL standards for the position will cause him to come up short. However, he has rare speed and athleticism and can single-handedly win games. Jackson's accuracy is clearly spotty and teams must decide the level of accuracy they are willing to live with relative to his ability to create explosive plays. Jackson may need to operate in an offense ready to integrate RPOs (run/pass options) along with heavy play-action. Like Deshaun Watson in 2017, Jackson has the ability to counter mental mistakes and turnovers with a high number of explosive, touchdown-making plays.

He came back with a vengeance in 2015, garnering USA Today Freshman All-American status by starting all 12 games and topping the squad with 49 receptions for 862 yards and nine touchdowns. He moonlighted with the SMU basketball team after that season (three games, three points, two rebounds). Sutton was a first-team All-AAC pick as a sophomore, ranking among the nation's top 20 in the major categories (76 catches, 1,246 yards, 10 touchdowns). His NFL size, downfield physicality, strong hands, and strider's deep speed could have led him to the next level after last season, but he chose to return to school for his fourth year.

He got work as a true freshman (64 rush, 410 yards, five TD; 7 receptions, 106 yards, TD), playing in eight games and gaining a start in the Belk Bowl against Louisville. Michel was the team's Offensive MVP and earned the Charley Trippi Most Versatile Player Award as a sophomore by running for 1,161 yards and eight scores on 219 rushes and 270 yards and three touchdowns on 26 receptions. The hits kept coming in 2016, as the team captain ran behind his pads, broke ankles and accelerated into the open field on his way to 840 yards and four scores on 152 carries (22 receptions, 149 yards, one TD). Michel won Offensive MVP award in the Liberty Bowl win over TCU by gaining 87 rushing yards and 39 receiving yards while scoring twice. Though he started only two games in 2017, scouts saw his immense potential in 14 contests; Michel ran for 1,227 yards on just 156 totes, an outstanding 7.9 yards per attempt, and scored 16 times on the ground. He also showed his wiggle and power on nine receptions covering 96 yards and a touchdown for the SEC champions.","Michel is a well-built, no-nonsense runner who is able to combine vision, burst, and physicality. While he can make open field cuts to find additional yardage, his running style is more angular in nature and he thrives when playing north-south.

Lack of agility precludes him from making late cuts to elude incoming tacklers. Low knee action in early stages of the run causes him to trip over blockers feet when trying to squeeze through tight running lanes. More angular runner than one who can make sharp cuts. Had some huge rushing lanes to work with thanks to scheme and improved blocking in 2017. Open field balance is inconsistent. Plays with a head-down, raging-bull mentality in short yardage and needs to improve his feel for finding creases.

Dante's father, Gary, played 11 seasons of major league baseball for four teams, winning five Gold Gloves as a centerfielder. His older cousin, Austin, was Boise State's all-time leading receiver before playing in the NFL for four seasons with the St. Louis Rams. Pettis was an all-conference high school football player at cornerback as a junior and receiver as a senior, while also playing hoops and competing at the California state track meet in the 200 meters and long jump. His athleticism got him on the field with the Huskies as a true freshman in a punt returner (28 att., 288 yards, TD) and part-time starting receiver (five starts in 13 games, 17 receptions, 259 yards, TD) role. Pettis excelled on special teams again as a sophomore, ranking fourth in the nation with 16.9 yards per punt return (16 att., 271 yards, two TD). He started eight of 13 games at receiver, as well (30 receptions, 414 yards, TD). Pettis combined with quarterback Jake Browning to explode on the national scene in 2016, displaying centerfielder-type hands as well as excellent toughness as a receiver, runner, and blocker. He ranked seventh in the FBS with 15 touchdown receptions and garnered second-team All-Pac-12 honors with 53 catches for 822 yards. His increased role on offense did not prevent him from making plays as a punt returner for the third straight season (25 att., 287 yards, two TD, ranked 10th in the FBS with 11.5 yards per return).","Solid secondary receiving option who has spent time on his craft and has the ability to attack and uncover on all three levels. Pettis lacks physicality and could struggle to handle in-your-face press corners, so he may see snaps from the slot.

Hurst walked on for the Gamecocks in the summer of 2015, playing in 12 games as a receiver and tight end, starting once, and making eight catches for 106 yards. He became a star in 2016, starting all 13 games at tight end and setting school records at the position for receptions (48) and yards (616) by consistently nabbing everything thrown his way and outmuscling defenders downfield (he scored one touchdown as well). Hurst was the first sophomore in USC history to be a team captain, albeit as a 23 year-old.

Wyoming head coach Craig Bohl saw Allen's talent, wondering if he could be another Carson Wentz, the number two overall pick for the Philadelphia Eagles who he recruited and coached at North Dakota State before moving to Laramie. Allen only got a chance to play in two games (4-of-6, 51 yards passing; 3 rushes, 40 yards) for the Cowboys in 2015, starting once, before breaking his right clavicle and taking a medical redshirt.

The Cowboys made the Mountain West Conference Championship game with his leadership in 14 starts, completing 56 percent of his passes (209-of-373) throwing for 3,203 yards and 28 touchdowns. That completion percentage and his 15 interceptions showed that his game needs to be tamed, and those concerns were only exacerbated in 2017. Allen was an honorable mention all-conference pick as a junior, but he finished 72nd in the country in passing efficiency by completing just 56.3 percent of his passes (152-of-270) for just 1,812 yards and 16 touchdowns against six interceptions. Allen struggled against Power Five foes Iowa (23-of-40, 174 yards, 2 INT) and Oregon (9-of-24, 64 yards, INT).

He was a first-team USA Today All-American as a high school senior, throwing for 3,186 yards and 29 touchdowns while his St. John Bosco squad won the California State Championship. UCLA coaches saw enough of his talent in the spring of 2015 (he graduated from high school one semester early) that they made him the first Bruin freshman opening-weekend starter ever. He won Pac-12 Freshman of the Year and several Freshman All-American honors after setting several school records and completing 60 percent (292-487) of his passes for 3,668  yards and 23 touchdowns (11 interceptions). Despite being only a freshman, he was in command of the offense and used his NFL size and arm to sling the ball all over the field. Rosen's sophomore season had its peaks (400 passing yards against Arizona State) and valleys (three interceptions vs. Texas A&M), and eventually ended with a season-ending injury to his throwing shoulder after six starts (59.3 completion percentage, 1,915 yards, 10 touchdowns, five interceptions). The surgery to his shoulder was not considered major, so he was throwing effectively in spring 2017 practices. Rosen had the performance of the year in the season's opening weekend, leading the Bruins in an amazing 45-44 comeback win with 491 passing yards and four touchdowns. He struggled over a four-game stretch at the start of the Pac-12 season, throwing eight of his 10 interceptions on the year. He did earn second-team All-Pac-12 notice, however, by completing 62.6 percent of his passes (283-452), throwing 26 touchdowns, and ranking second in the country with 341.5 passing yards a game (3,756 total). Rosen also suffered two concussions during the year, missing one regular season contest and their bowl game against Kansas State.","Josh Rosen's footwork and mechanics make him as pretty a quarterback as you will find in this year's draft. The biggest concern with Rosen is that his on-field success requires many elements to stay on schedule. He lacks plus arm strength, so identifying coverage (pre- and post-snap) and throwing with anticipation takes on added importance. Rosen has the pocket poise, accuracy and intelligence to become a good NFL starter, but he needs to be willing to take what defenses give him more frequently. Rosen will need to quell concerns surrounding leadership and coachability early on in order to establish a strong first impression and get his career off on the right foot.","""He wasn't the guy everyone rallied around in college and you don't have to dig around for too long to find people who said he was hard to coach.

Again, he showed versatility with 31 receptions for 383 yards and five scores. His junior season was even more successful, as his cutting ability, supreme balance, and galloping speed allowed him to be named a consensus first-team FCS All-American with 1,799 yards (led FCS with 163.5 yards per game) and 19 touchdowns (ranked third) on 257 carries. Edmonds set an FCS record by averaging 21.1 yards per carry against Lafayette (17-359, four touchdowns). Unfortunately, leg injuries limited Edmonds to seven starts in 2017 (136-577, five touchdowns rushing; 11-129 receiving) and squashed his hopes of setting the all-time FCS rushing record. He was, however, named second-team All-Patriot League for his efforts.","Edmonds is a highly productive runner with a compact frame, good agility and plus athletic traits.

NC State coaches call him an H-back, but he's really just an offensive weapon. Samuels was a first-team all-conference selection as a senior, ending up the Wolfpack's leading receiver (76 receptions, 597 yards, four TDs) while being a major threat in the red zone (76 receptions, 404 yards, 12 TDs). He was named third-team All-ACC pick in 2016, leading his team with 55 catches (for 565 yards, seven scores) and finishing third on the squad in rushing (33 rush, 189 yards, six TDs). He was named the Offensive MVP in the Independence Bowl win over Vanderbilt (six receptions, 104 yards, three TDs). Samuels started 10 of 13 games played for the second straight year in 2016, one year after winning All-American, first-team All-ACC, and Pack Offensive MVP honors by leading all tight ends nationally in receptions (65 receptions, 597 yards, seven TDs) and running for 368 yards and nine touchdowns on 56 attempts. In limited touches as a freshman, Samuels showed glimpses of his talent (15 rush, 143 yards, TD; six receptions, 96 yards, one TD). This versatility was not a surprise, as Samuels was the top prospect in North Carolina in high school after putting up 2,300 yards of total offense and 55 touchdowns as a senior.","Some may see Samuels as a valuable hybrid talent, while others may see a player who offers roster flexibility but lacks a position where he can win consistently. Samuels isn't a tight end and has to prove he can handle blocking duties well enough to be a fullback. He will, however, appeal to teams looking to disguise their attacks with more diversified personnel groupings. Samuels best fit may be with a zone-scheme team as a RB/FB with the ability to play slot receiver and become a core special teamer.","""Here is the problem I'm having in writing my report.

Good ball tracker on wheel routes. Hands are sticky like a wideout. Will stick a stiff shoulder into chip blocks and is willing to stand in against blitzers. Didn't fumble over his last 274 carries. ",Way too much dancing as off-set back. Shows distrust of the blocking plan and will void the rush track early. Takes long looks for clear point of entry rather than finding the crease.

Mahomes began his career by starting the Red Raiders' final four games his true freshman year (1,547 yards, 16 TDs, four INTs, 56.8 completion percentage), one of those games being a 598-yard, six-touchdown effort against a top-10 team in Baylor. He earned honorable mention All-Big 12 notice for the second straight year in 2015, starting every game and leading the FBS with 393 yards of total offense per game (4,653 yards, 36 TDs, 15 INTs, 63.5 completion pct). Mahomes was a second-team all-conference pick in his final year with Tech in 2016, leading the FBS with 421 passing yards per game (5,052 total, 41 TDs, 10 INTs, 65.7 completion pct). He's also been a threat with his big-bodied frame and strong legs the past three years, scoring 22 times on the ground.","Mahomes is a big, confident quarterback who brings a variety of physical tools to the party, but he's developed some bad habits and doesn't have a very repeatable process as a passer. Mahomes' ability to improvise and extend plays can lead to big plays for his offense, but he will have to prove he can operate with better anticipation and be willing to take what the defense gives him in order to win from the pocket. Mahomes will be a work in progress, but he's a high ceiling, low floor prospect.","""He's got a great arm, big balls and he's mobile.

Competes as a runner and is willing to go the extra mile for the first down.",Can be inconsistent in his approach. Needs to play inside the offense and show more discipline. Too eager to go big game hunting. Ravenous appetite for the explosive play can also bring unwanted trouble. Willingness to default to playground style appears to limit his ability to get into a consistent rhythm. Needs to improve anticipatory reads and learn to take what the defense gives him. Decision making can go from good to bad in a moment's notice. Operates from a narrow base and allows his upper body and arm to race ahead of his feet. Has a dip and wind-up in his standard release. Explosive delivery and follow-through causes some throws to sail. Needs better touch on intermediate and deep balls. Carries ball a little low in the pocket. Impatient.

Coleman can get instant separation to create favorable passing windows and is one of the top playmakers in this draft.

Henry's long legs and angular running style is a much better fit for downhill running teams who value lead backs and physicality.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch High School Offensive Player of the Year as a senior, Elliott also had the speed to win four state titles in track and field (100 meters, 200 meters, 110 high hurdles, and 300 hurdles).  He contributed as a reserve in his freshman year in Columbus (30-262, two TD rushing) before hitting it big in 2014, finishing with three straight 200-yard games, including two against Alabama which (scoring six times in those two contests) helped the Buckeyes win the national title. Elliott carried forth the momentum from the end of his honorable mention All-Big Ten sophomore year into 2015, when he received the Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year award (1,821 yards, 23 TD rushing; 27-206 receiving) and second-team All-American notice from the Associated Press and USA Today. Unfortunately, Ohio State's home loss to Michigan State on a terrible weather day, in which Elliott received only 15 carries (complaining to the media afterwards about his lack of totes), prevented the team from defending its title in the College Football Playoff.

Boyd grew up not far from Pittsburgh, and stood out even in a football-crazy state like Pennsylvania, setting the state record with 117 career touchdowns and winning the Class A Player of the Year twice. As a freshman, Boyd didn’t disappoint, garnering third-team All-ACC honors with 85 catches covering 1,174 yards and seven scores. He also ran for 108 yards and earned 425 kick return yards for the season, as well as returning a punt 54 yards for a score in the team’s bowl game.

He redshirted his first year on campus, but then stepped in to become a three-year starter for Fuente. Lynch went through some ups and downs in his first year as a starter, throwing nine touchdowns against 10 interceptions and completing just 58 percent of his passes for about 2,000 yards in 2013. He improved greatly as a sophomore, leading his team to a 10-win season and American Athletic Conference championship. He received second team All-AAC honors that season by completing 63 percent of his passes for 3,031 yards and 22 scores.  Lynch exploded onto the national scene during his junior year, garnering a Manning Award finalist nod, first team All-ACC honors, and team MVP after leading the Tigers to an 8-0 start before the team struggled down the stretch losing to Navy, Houston, and Temple. During the team’s hot streak, Lynch beat SEC foe Ole Miss with a 39-for-53, 386-yard, three-touchdown performance. But the next time he faced a SEC defense, Auburn took him to task in the Birmingham Bowl, forcing him to complete just 16 of 37 pass attempts for a measly 106 yards and an interception. Despite finishing the season on a down note, the departure of Fuente for Virginia Tech and positive accolades received from the NFL scouting community led Lynch to take his talents to the next level.","While the hype around ""dual threat"" quarterbacks has subsided, Lynch possesses the size and athleticism to make NFL teams take a second look. Unlike other size/speed quarterbacks like Vince Young and Colin Kaepernick, Lynch prefers to extend passing plays with his feet rather than bolting from the pocket, but he is still likely to make plenty of plays with his feet over the long haul. Lynch shows the ability to read defenses and make smart decisions, but not yet at an NFL starting level.

Hogan's handled it very well, battling through inconsistency before leading the Cardinal to a Pac-12 title as a senior. He was named honorable mention All-Pac-12 and Pac-12 Championship Game MVP in his redshirt freshman year, but failed to earn any accolades in 2013 even though his team won the Pac-12 championship. Hogan’s numbers were actually pretty good in 2014 (65.9 percent, 2,792 yards, 19 touchdowns, eight interceptions), but the team had a disappointing 8-5 season, leading some to question his ability as a leader. However, he came back strong in 2015, improving his accuracy (67.8 completion percentage) while passing for 2,867 yards and 27 touchdowns to garner second-team All-Pac-12 honors and finishing as a finalist for the Manning Award as the nation's top quarterback. Hogan certainly looks the part (6-foot-4, 218), has football genes in his family (close relatives played at Navy, Arizona, and Notre Dame), has won a lot of games (36-10 as a starter), and possesses the athleticism to be effective running the zone read (85 carries, 336 yards, six touchdowns in 2015) at that size.","Hogan has the size, mobility and quarterback's demeanor that could interest a team on the third day of the draft. He doesn’t have the arm that many teams look for and his intermediate and deep accuracy still need work. Hogan will need time and coaching to try and improve his mechanics and footwork if he wants to have a shot to be an NFL backup.","""Some coach is going to fall in love with the person and bang on the table to take him late.

Doesn't always look pretty, but finds ways to make winning plays in adverse situations. Doesn't get cute and feeds his top talent. Tasked to manage the offense and did just that. Smart and self­-aware. Understands his strengths and weaknesses and doesn’t take very many low percentage chances. Was the most accurate short-yardage passer in Pac-12 at 76.7 percent.","Mechanics and footwork are a mess. Throws with a very wide base, a pitcher's stride and a protracted delivery. Ball rarely comes out of his hands cleanly. Plays flat­-footed in the pocket with little bounce as he scans field and does a poor job of re­setting and coming to balance before delivery. Below-average arm strength and struggles to consistently make accurate, catchable throws to the field side. Average at reading defenses, preventing him from getting ball out on time. Needs much more poise and pocket awareness. Had issues climbing and sliding to clean areas of the pocket when they were there. Drops eyes and immediately panics when pressure is mounting in his face.

As a sophomore, Smallwood was second on the team with 722 rushing yards and two scores on 148 carries, and contributed 31 catches for 326 yards as a receiver. He had showed promise as a true freshman, as well, (39-221 rushing; 11-132 receiving, one start in 12 games), but he nearly was untracked in the following offseason after being arrested on a warrant for a witness tampering charge. Smallwood was accused of telling someone to recant their statement accusing one of his friends in a fatal shooting case. The charges were officially dropped when his friend pleaded guilty in the murder case, allowing Smallwood to continue his football career.","Smallwood changed West Virginia from an ""Air Raid"" offense to a ""ground and pound"" attack. Smallwood's tape features few, true flash plays, but the quality runs seem to stack up one after another.

Both those figures led the Big Ten, becoming just the second Spartans player to lead the conference in that category (Kirk Gibson in 1976 and 1978). When Cook went back to pass, his first, second and third looks were to Burbridge as he trusted his teammate to make the clutch third-down catch as well as high-point the deep ball.","Outside receiver with good height and weight but lacking the deep speed to beat NFL cornerbacks down the field.

Does a nice job selling his patterns, getting good depth in his routes and immediately looking for the ball out of his breaks. Nice job deceiving defenders and finding soft spots in coverage to make something happen after the catch, averaging over 13 yards per catch in 2012. Has experience all over the offense for Stanford, lining up in-line, slot and out wide, but looked most comfortable in the slot.

Hard worker on and off the field and plans to graduate in June.","Missed half of his sophomore year due to injury. Must prove his straight-line speed to scouts. Will not elude NFL defensive backs after the catch with pure quickness. Inconsistent in-line blocker, can get after his man but also loses the leverage battle and gets pushed back too easily. Misses second-level blocks when lunging at targets instead of getting position. Nice job adding bulk to his frame, but needs to continue to develop his strength to sustain blocks at the line of scrimmage.

He is a very aggressive catcher who literally attacks the ball when it is within his large catching radius, and he has the ability to use his frame to box out defenders. Blackmon can naturally adjust to poorly thrown balls on the run and can bail quarterbacks out of poorly thrown balls.","Blackmon is not as quick off the ball as his athletic ability would suggest. He has good top-end speed and acceleration in the open field, but struggles to burst enough in short areas to separate. He has such an elongated stride as a runner that he has difficulties running sharp routes. Much of his production comes from being a playmaker at the point of the catch and afterwards; he doesn't get himself open through route running. As a blocker, he is an all-or-nothing type who can't recover once whiffing on a block. He will need a lot of work on his technique in this area.

<p><em>-- by Chad Reuter</em></p>","<p>Williams’ play is highlighted by rare escapability paired with the talent to exploit defenses once the play breaks down. He’s not tall, but he is well-built, with an arm to challenge defenses across the field. He can be a high-impact playmaker on the go or an effective pocket passer when he allows himself to trust his eyes on second and third reads. He can improve his accuracy and placement on intermediate and deep throws, but he’s unlikely to be known for pinpoint accuracy. It is admirable that he looks to keep his eyes up and make throws outside the pocket, but he’ll make things easier on himself early in his pro career by becoming a more decisive scrambler to move the sticks and carry on to the next set of downs. Williams is tremendously talented but often bites off too much responsibility and plays off-schedule.

<p><em>-- by Chad Reuter</em></p>","<p>With five seasons of starting experience under his belt, Daniels possesses a rare blend of playmaking talent and command from the pocket. He’s tall but slender, so there will be concerns about durability, considering how often he ran in college. However, teams must also recognize that he has no issues sitting in the pocket and working through progressions as a platform thrower with good mechanics and footwork. Daniels possesses the football intelligence to get himself protected and take care of the football with quality decision-making. He’s an accurate passer over the first two levels and throws with anticipation to slice and dice zone coverages. He had noticeable issues putting deep throws on faster receivers in stride, though. He lacks ideal size and arm talent, but he’s much more capable as a runner and passer than most of the quarterbacks who have moved on to the next level lately. Daniels is positioned to become a very good NFL starter in a spread-based passing attack.</p>",,,"<ul>

Despite a lack of polish and precision as a route-runner, Nabers’ gliding movements and speed alterations seem to disguise the top-end speed and separation potential that await opposing coverages. He’s a bouncy leaper with the athletic ability to make the impossible catches possible. He tucks away accurate throws and displays the toughness and play strength to fight for tight-window victories over the middle. Nabers will need to address his tendency to track and play deep throws with finesse, or his early advantages will turn into 50/50 battles.

He has a tendency to cruise through routes rather than working with attention to detail and pacing. He was a decorated high school sprinter, so speed should not be an issue in the pros.

<p><em>-- by Chad Reuter</em></p>","<p>Penix will be a 24-year-old rookie with a history of season-ending injuries at Indiana and impressive production while at Washington. The Huskies’ offensive design helped declutter coverages for Penix, allowing him to throw a higher number of intermediate and deep passes. He plays with smart pocket mobility and a willingness to get rid of the football, which makes it difficult to sack him. His delivery is bundled and his release point is very low, but his monster game against Texas showed flashes of impeccable touch. Penix has plenty of arm but needs to work with more consistent timing between the numbers to eliminate unnecessary contested throws. He’s a pocket passer who was ineffective in 2023 when defenses were able to crank up the heat and make him move his feet. Playing in a shotgun-based spread attack might give him his best chance to succeed, but he needs to prove he can thrive outside of the Washington offense and stay free from injury.</p>","“He played well (in 2023) and hasn’t missed a game since he got to Washington, but you just can’t turn a blind eye to all the games he’s missed and all the injuries he’s had.” - NFC area scout",Tua Tagovailoa,"<ul>

Guerendo is built like a prototypical Badger runner, with a thick, well-proportioned frame. He was a much more decisive runner in 2023, but his cut-and-go burst is fairly average.

He can catch it out of the backfield and protect his quarterback, making him a suitable three-down backup.

<p><em>-- by Chad Reuter</em></p>","<p>Tracy was a full-time running back for only one year but had exciting flashes all over his tape. He’s a bendy, rhythmic runner who sees and traverses the interior run lanes like he built the maze. He creates additional yardage with a blend of elusiveness, power and a willful desire to maximize each run, but he will need to curb his eagerness to bounce runs wide when it’s time to finish and move to the next snap. While he’s still honing his skills as a runner, his ability to handle gadget runs and threaten linebackers out of the backfield could get him on the field early on. Tracy will be an older rookie, but his versatility and burgeoning talent as a complementary runner should open evaluators’ eyes to what he could become as a pro.</p>",,Bilal Powell,"<ul>
